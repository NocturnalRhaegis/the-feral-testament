It was raining when I found him.

Face down on an Oregon sidewalk, the wet concrete dark with blood that shouldn't be there—his blood. The smell hit first. Metallic, wrong. Like burnt copper and panic. Then the sight—Red’s body twisted, too still, too quiet. A predator shouldn’t ever lie like that.

I don’t remember screaming, but I know I did.

I dropped to my knees so hard I think I cracked bone, hands fumbling until I found the source—the artery pulsing out his life in thick, desperate gulps. I jammed two fingers into the wound, pinched it shut like I was clamping down on Death itself. It squirmed. It didn’t want to go quietly.

“Stay with me,” I whispered, or begged. “Don’t you fucking do this to me.”

His eyes fluttered—just a twitch—but it was enough to make my throat close. Blood soaked my wrists. My arms. My soul.

And that’s when it hit me.

If he died, I’d follow. Not out of some grand romantic tragedy bullshit. No, something colder. Truer. The kind of bond that doesn’t care if it’s healthy or right—it just is.

“I can’t lose you,” I said, voice breaking, forehead pressed to his. “If you're gone, I’ll walk into the ocean and let it take me. I’ll die with my teeth bared, Red, but I’ll die. Because I love you. Gods help me, I fucking love you.”

And then—I broke.

Tears poured out, unrelenting. I cried like I was eight years old and couldn’t stop the fists from falling. I cried for Xavier’s paper-thin skin and hollow bones. For a home that had no warmth. For the monster I’d been turned into. For all the years I wasted thinking I wasn’t worth saving.

I wept over his broken body like it was an altar.

When help finally arrived, I didn’t move. I rode in the ambulance with one hand still clamped on the wound until they sedated him, stabilized him, and finally told me they’d try the shift-stim. “Try,” like the gods hadn’t already made up their minds.

The adrenaline worked. The shift took.

But I still didn’t leave.

I climbed onto that hospital bed like I belonged there—because I did. I curled around his half-shifted frame and stayed until he woke, looking like hell and already pissed.

"You look like shit,” he rasped, voice hoarse and cracked.

“You died, asshole,” I growled, hand brushing back his hair. “And you took me with you.”

Red coughed a laugh, wincing. “That why you finally grew a pair and told me?”

I winced harder. “I was trying to protect you. From me.”

He blinked slowly, then gave me that dry, devastating smirk. “You don’t get to decide that for both of us, jackass.”

“I was a monster,” I whispered.

“You still are,” he said gently. “But you’re my monster. And I’ve always known.”

Silence hung between us then. Not awkward. Not broken. Just... honest.
