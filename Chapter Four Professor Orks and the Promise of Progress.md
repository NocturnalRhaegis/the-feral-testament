_Los Alamos to Cambridge – Age 22_

Miguel never really believed in miracles. But Xavier's sudden recovery felt close enough.

It began slow—fewer hospital visits, steadier hands, more color in his skin. By sixteen, Xavier was taller than Miguel and running on a treadmill without collapsing. The doctors had no real explanation. Genes that once doomed him to a short life had… stabilized. Shifted. Adapted.

Miguel wanted answers. Not for Xavier’s sake anymore—he was _thriving_. But for himself. Because if suffering could _reverse_, if broken blueprints could _rewrite themselves_, then maybe every theory he chased in the dark had a spark of truth.

By twenty-two, Miguel was the youngest in his Master’s program—accepted on a full scholarship to a competitive genetic sciences initiative in Cambridge. He worked twice as hard as everyone else, slept half as much, and still outperformed most of his peers. Not because he needed to prove something—_because he couldn’t stop_.

The lab was his sanctuary. A sterile heaven of microscopes and soft glows, where blood didn’t stain walls and voices never rose above casual inquiry.

And at the center of that sanctuary was Professor Riegel Orks.


Dr. Orks was a geneticist with the soul of a warrior and the hands of a surgeon—quick, meticulous, and precise. He had the bearing of a man who had seen brutality and survived it by refusing to become it.

From the start, he saw something in Miguel that other instructors missed: a rage so tightly folded into ambition it was practically indistinguishable.

Most professors challenged Miguel. Orks _channeled_ him.

Genetics 301 was where it started. A deep dive into gene expression, mutation patterns, and epigenetic drift. Miguel’s favorite part was the CRISPR lab, where they edited bacteria strains by hand, stitching new instructions into life itself like digital gods. Miguel excelled, naturally, but Orks didn’t praise him for speed or brilliance.

“You treat every sequence like it owes you an apology,” Orks once said. “Like if you just crack the code, the past will undo itself.”

Miguel didn’t respond. But he came to office hours the next day.

Again. And again.

Soon, they weren’t just talking about methyl groups and telomere decay. Orks asked about New Mexico. About Xavier. He never pushed, but he _listened_. And Miguel, who had spent his entire life surviving silence, began to _speak_.

It was Orks who first suggested the Amazon.

“There’s a tribe,” he explained one evening, passing Miguel a thin dossier sealed in a dull manila folder. “Remote. Unmapped. Their genetic markers don’t follow any known phylogenetic pattern. There’s a hypothesis that their genome may have latent or novel epigenetic regulation we’ve never seen.”

Miguel opened the folder and stared. He didn’t speak for a full minute.

“You want me to chase godblood.”

“I want you to chase _truth_. Whatever shape it takes.”

That was the moment Miguel stopped seeing Riegel as a professor and started seeing him as something more. A mentor, yes. But also a compass. Someone who _believed_ in who Miguel might become—outside the trauma, outside the teeth.

Miguel agreed to lead the field expedition.

It would be his thesis. His magnum opus.

His last step as a man of science.

Before the jungle swallowed him. Before the bite.
