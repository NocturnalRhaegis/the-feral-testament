(Verse 1)
I’ve seen the storms, I’ve felt the flood,
Stood knee-deep in the rivers of blood.
They threw the world to tear us apart,
But nothing could shake the steel in my heart.
Your strength, your fire, they keep me alive,
With you by my side, I don’t just survive.

(Pre-Chorus)
Through flames and fury, through shadowed despair,
No force could ever keep me from where you are.
I’d bleed, I’d burn, I’d break every chain,
For you, I’d do it all again.

(Chorus)
I’d walk through fire, crawl on broken glass,
Swim through lava, leave the past in ash.
No mountain too high, no valley too low,
To keep you with me, there’s nowhere I won’t go.
Our bond is unbreakable, stronger than steel,
With you, I am endless, alive, and real.

(Verse 2)
Your voice is my armor, your touch my shield,
In your presence, every wound is healed.
They tried to drown us in oceans of pain,
But, love, we rose like a hurricane.
I see forever in your fearless gaze,
A fire that burns through the darkest days.

(Pre-Chorus)
When the earth crumbles, when the sky turns black,
I’ll keep running, I’ll never turn back.
Your love’s the light that guides my way,
With you, I’m invincible every day.

(Chorus)
I’d walk through fire, crawl on broken glass,
Swim through lava, leave the past in ash.
No mountain too high, no valley too low,
To keep you with me, there’s nowhere I won’t go.
Our bond is unbreakable, stronger than steel,
With you, I am endless, alive, and real.

(Bridge)
Every scar I bear, every battle I’ve fought,
Has led to the life that your love has brought.
I’d tear through the heavens, defy the stars,
To hold you forever, no matter how far.
Through the tempest, the fire, the endless fight,
I’ll keep you close, you’re my reason, my light.

(Chorus/Outro)
I’d walk through fire, crawl on broken glass,
Swim through lava, leave the past in ash.
No mountain too high, no valley too low,
To keep you with me, there’s nowhere I won’t go.
Our bond is unbreakable, forged in the flame,
With you, Red, I’ll always remain.
Unbreakable, unstoppable, forever we’ll be,
Bound by love, wild and free.
