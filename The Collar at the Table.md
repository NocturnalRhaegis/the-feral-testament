George’s dining room was warm. Safe. A golden sanctuary stitched from old wood, red velvet, and candlelight. London whispered outside the frosted windows, all rain and heartbeat, while the silverware chimed softly between friends.

Laughter came easy.

Until the box appeared.

Small. Black. Velvet.

Karma slid it across the table with a shy grin, nudging Seras in the side. “It’s not a ring,” she said. “I know you, baby. You don’t wear diamonds.”

Seras blinked, then opened the lid.

Inside: satin, silver, and a shining buckle.

A collar.

Elegant. Handmade. Beautiful.

But Noc didn’t see craftsmanship.

He saw fire.

He saw chains.

He saw blood in his teeth and steel around his throat and her voice saying _“What will break you?”_ over and over like a lullaby with no ending.

He stood so fast his chair slammed backward.

The table went still.

Red flinched. Riegel sat up straight. Karma’s eyes widened.

But Seras—Seras looked confused. Then hurt. Then angry.

“Seriously?” she snapped, standing to face him. “What the fuck, Dad? You’re not even going to _pretend_ to be happy for me?”

Noc didn’t answer.

He was staring at the collar.

Not at her.

Not at anyone.

Just that thin, innocent loop of silver.

Seras reached for it protectively. “This isn’t about you. This is _ours_. We’re not you and Red. We don’t _have_ to be.”

Still nothing.

Red rose halfway, like he might reach for him—but didn’t.

And then Noc spoke.

Flat. Hollow. A dead thing dragging itself from a pit.

> “When I was eight, my brother started coughing blood. My parents sold our furniture to keep him alive. Then they sold everything else. Then they started selling themselves.”

Seras faltered.

The whole table froze.

Noc didn’t notice.

> “When I was ten, I broke my arm defending him from a man who thought my mother’s son came with the price. She never thanked me. She said I scared him off.”

A pause.

His hands were shaking, but not from rage.

> “When I was fifteen, I got a scholarship. Los Alamos. Physics and myth. Thought maybe I could save someone. Thought maybe if I could find something powerful enough, I could fix it.”

His eyes were far away now.

> “So I wrote a thesis. About shapeshifters. South American legends. Got it approved. Packed my things. And flew into the jungle with notebooks, dreams, and a death wish.”

Seras was sinking back into her seat. Karma’s hand found hers beneath the table.

> “She was already there. Watching. Reading my notes. Whispering to the people who fed me. Leaving blood signs on trees to scare them off.”

> “I woke up alone one morning. Everyone gone. Nothing but silence and rot. And her.”

> “She bit me three nights later.”

Riegel inhaled sharply. Red went still.

> “It took me sixteen hours to change. Most of it I don’t remember. Bones breaking. Skin screaming. But I remember her face. Watching. Like it was Christmas morning.”

> “And when it was over…”

He looked up.

> “She collared me.”

The silence wasn’t quiet anymore. It was _suffocating._

> “Silver. Around my throat. Burned so deep it fused into the muscle.”

> “She kept me in a cell. For months. No light. No food unless I killed. She’d throw people in. Her enemies. Her pets. Teenagers.”

A beat.

> “My first kill was a seventeen-year-old named Alexander. He cried the whole time. So did I.”

Seras made a sound. Small. Broken.

> “I never told anyone. Not even Red.”

Noc’s voice didn’t change. Still flat. Still unflinching.

> “She made me a monster. And I let her. I stopped counting the bodies after forty.”

He exhaled.

> “You can love whoever you want, Seras. You can kneel. You can dominate. You can build something beautiful out of power. But don’t ever ask me to smile at a collar.”

> “Not on you.”

The silence held.

No one moved.

Then Red stood and walked to his side, gently placing a hand on Noc’s shoulder.

He didn’t speak. He didn’t need to.

Riegel looked away.

Karma stared at her lap.

And Seras—Seras just wept.

Quiet, angry tears sliding down her cheeks as she clutched Karma’s hand like it was the only thing keeping her anchored.

She didn’t reach for the collar again.

And Noc didn’t sit back down.
