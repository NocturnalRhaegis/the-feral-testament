Red had questions the moment they hit the threshold of the Legendary Realm—mostly starting with "Why does this place smell like jasmine and divine expectation?"—but Noc waved them off with a vague grunt and something about “spiritual calibration.”

He'd been quieter than usual on the trip, taut as a bowstring, like he was walking into a battlefield instead of whatever cryptic nonsense he’d arranged. Red clocked it, but didn’t press. Noc's weird was just part of the package. That, and the secret gleam behind his war-weary eyes—the one that only showed up when he had a plan he wasn’t ready to share yet.

And then they turned the corner.

The clearing was glowing. Not metaphorically—actually glowing. Petals made of stardust fell from above. Dozens of people stood in reverent silence, a who’s-who of their broken, beautiful family. Libra was crying already. Kozilek looked like he was ready to punch someone just to balance out the emotions. Spirits shimmered on the edge of vision, too sacred to name.

And at the center of it all, standing proud and uncertain in ceremonial leathers polished to a dull shine, was her. Red’s mother. Or rather, the soul of the woman he’d never known, standing in the Legendary Realm to bear witness to her son’s happiness.

Red froze.

Noc didn’t. He turned to him, jaw set like he was ready to be hit or kissed—or both.

“I know you,” Noc said, voice low and raw. “You’d never leave me. Not really. But I’ve always been afraid I’d find a reason to leave you. That I’d convince myself it was nobler to walk away, to protect you from what I am. So I didn’t give myself the chance.”

He stepped closer, and the crowd faded into the background. “This is the only way I could do it. Trick myself into something good. Because I love you, Red. I have always loved you. And if I gave myself time to think, I’d drown in my own doubt. So here we are. You don’t have to say yes, but... this is me. Asking you. To marry me.”

Red’s eyes had gone glassy. His voice, when it came, was hoarse with unshed storms.

“You dumb, gorgeous bastard,” he breathed, grabbing Noc by the collar. “You think I would’ve let you back out of this? You’re mine, and you’ve been mine since the first time you stitched up my ribs and told me not to get used to the kindness.”

He kissed him hard, and somewhere in the distance, the universe exhaled.

Red's POV – The Wedding in the Legendary Realm

He knew something was up the moment they stepped through the Moon Bridge.

It wasn’t the air—it always smelled like ozone and possibility in the Legendary Realm. No, it was the silence that did it. The kind that feels loaded, like a held breath right before thunder cracks.

The second they crested the hill and the vista opened up before them, Red froze mid-step.

There was a clearing laid out in soft golden light. Rows of hand-carved benches made from driftwood and petrified bone, woven through with silverleaf vines. A small altar sat under a canopy of aurora silk, rippling like spiritlight in the wind. And standing before it, flanked by a pack of familiar faces—including Kozilek in ceremonial armor and Takoda looking suspiciously smug—was a grinning old priest-spirit who Red swore he’d seen once in a fever dream after too much chiminage wine.

Then the music hit. Low, old, and aching with meaning. And that’s when the son of a bitch realized what was happening.

“This is a wedding,” he said out loud, voice catching in his throat like it didn’t know how to be words anymore. He turned, slowly, to look at Noc.

Noc, who was already in a sharp, ink-dark suit trimmed with soulmetal thread. His long coat moved like smoke. His hands, for once, weren’t fidgeting. His face... gods. His face. It was terrified. Hopeful. Bare.

“It’s your wedding,” Noc said quietly, stepping forward. “You just didn’t know you were invited.”

Red stared at him, mouth open, brain short-circuiting like a fried Nexus Crawler.

“You tricked me.”

“Yep.”

“Into marrying you.”

“Technically it’s a wedding, not a hostage situation.”

“You didn’t ask.”

“If I had, I’d have talked myself out of it. Framed it as protecting you from my bullshit. You know I would’ve.”

Red swallowed. Hard. Gods, he would’ve. And gods help him, Red would’ve let him.

Because Noc had always seen himself as broken glass—sharp, dangerous, impossible to hold without bleeding. But Red… Red had always seen the light coming through him.

Red stepped closer. Looked him in the eye.

“You are the most reckless, infuriating, noble bastard I’ve ever met.”

Noc gave a half-grin. “Still yes?”

Red grabbed his shirt, pulled him forward, and kissed him like it was a promise.

“Yeah, asshole. It’s always been yes.”

The clearing in the Legendary Realm was silver-lit and humming with presence—Gaian spirits rustling through the otherworldly trees, old gods watching from the periphery, and ancestors who had long since shed their names standing vigil in quiet honor.

Red stood at the heart of it all, his hands still warm from Noc’s, his heartbeat thundering in his ears for reasons he was only just beginning to understand.

But just beyond the ring of lanterns and braided garlands, someone watched.

A woman—tall, with hair the same impossible shade as Red’s when the sun hit it right, with a posture caught between battle-readiness and heartbreak. Her eyes didn’t move, not even when the crowd cheered or Noc’s voice trembled during his speech. She only watched him.

At first, Red thought she was a trick of the Realm—some spirit conjured by sentiment, maybe. But then she smiled, and he felt it like a sunbeam down his spine.

He took a few steps toward her before he even realized he was moving.

Noc, still mid-conversation with a spirit-dragon-thing (probably), turned, saw where Red was looking—and for once, said nothing. Just nodded.

So Red kept walking.

“Do I know you?” he asked, low and careful, because there was a sacredness about her, and he didn’t want to shatter it.

“You know of me,” she answered, voice softer than mist, but strong. “And I’ve known you since the first time you cried in a bassinet. You kicked like a fury, even then.”

The way she looked at him made his throat tighten. Like she was memorizing the way his soul moved beneath his skin.

“I’m sorry I wasn’t there,” she added, and it nearly undid him.

He blinked fast. “Are you—?”

“I’m your mother, love.” She reached out, but stopped short. “If you’ll let me be.”

Red’s breath hitched like a snapped wire. All those years wondering. The hollow spaces in his history. The aching not-knowing.

And now, here she stood, not as myth or ghost or tragic past. Just… a woman who had once made an impossible choice, and never stopped loving him for a second after.

“I think,” Red said, the corners of his eyes wet now, “that you already are.”

She smiled like the moon breaking through stormclouds.

“I only asked for one thing, when he came to me,” she whispered, tilting her head toward where Noc stood, trying to act like he wasn’t definitely watching the whole thing from the corner of his eye. “To see you happy. He made that happen. That man loves you so much it echoes through time.”

Red gave a broken laugh. “Yeah. He’s a lunatic.”

“Lunatic,” she repeated, smiling wider. “And yours.”

Then she leaned in, kissed his temple, and disappeared like a sigh on the wind.

Red stepped back into the clearing where Noc stood, the world softening and quieting around them, though it still hummed with the ancient power of this place. He caught Noc’s eye and, without speaking, Noc knew.

Red had met her.

Her.

The one who wasn’t just a ghost, or a memory, or a story.

Red had a thousand words for what he was feeling—shock, awe, confusion, relief, grief—but none of them made sense. None of them could. He was still trying to untangle all of it in his mind.

But Noc didn’t need words. He knew, too. The way Red stood—open, vulnerable, and a little broken—and the way his eyes didn’t quite focus. It was a perfect match for the unspeakable weight that Red had carried all these years. The absence of her. The hole in his heart.

And now, she was real. Realer than he'd ever dreamed.

“You okay?” Noc asked quietly, his voice a soft anchor in the dizzying storm Red felt himself caught in.

Red smiled—tired, weary—but undeniably real. “I think so.”

Noc stepped forward, pulled Red into his arms without hesitation, without the usual teasing or bravado. Just an understanding. The kind of hug that said, I get it. I see you.

For a long moment, they stood there, breathing each other in. No words necessary. No need for explanations. Just the steady presence of each other—something neither of them had ever really known before, but now they couldn’t imagine living without.

Red's voice broke the silence, soft and raw, but steady. “She told me… that you love me. That you always have.”

Noc's throat tightened. “I do.”

“I didn’t know,” Red said, so quiet, so vulnerable. “I didn’t know what it meant, what it really felt like, until today.”

“Yeah,” Noc whispered. “Me neither.”

Red took a breath, then pulled away slightly to look at Noc, his fingers brushing against his jaw. “So… what now?”

Noc let out a low laugh. “Now? We make sure we don’t screw this up.”

Red smirked, his thumb tracing Noc’s lip before they leaned in. No more hesitations. No more playing games. Just the two of them, finally letting go of the ghosts that had haunted them for so long.

Because they were home now. Together. And nothing, nothing, could tear them apart.


**Red Knight – After the Vows**

The music had faded.

The guests—what few could tread where they stood—had gone quiet, fading into the edges of the Realm like mist at sunrise. The Legendary Realm had never felt so still. So real.

And Noc, his Noc, was standing beside him.

Hair braided back with Rissa’s hands. Suit half-starched, half-wrung with nerves. That strange, beautiful tension of a man who never believed he deserved love… being loved _anyway._

Red’s hands still trembled a little from the vows. Not from fear. Just from the sheer _magnitude_ of what had happened.

They were married.  
They were **here.**

But the cell still lingered in the back of Red’s mind.

---

**The Cage**

It was never supposed to get that far.

Red had promised himself, _sworn_ to Gaia, that he’d never let Noc suffer like that again—not after Romania, not after Maryska, not after those fucking silver scars they’d both tried so hard to ignore.

But you can’t always stop it.

You can only stand guard.

And Red had.

He'd held vigil while the man he loved howled into a void only he could see. He'd taken bloodstained cloth and cleaned it again and again, as if somehow, caring for the wounds on the outside might reach the ones on the inside. He'd buried Libra with mud in his teeth and grief in his bones, and still, still, he came back to sit by the bars.

_“I knew you’d find your way back.”_

He hadn't known. Not really.

He’d _hoped._

---

**The Altar**

Now here they were—no silver, no bars.

Only starlight and the faint echo of the Pretenders still drifting through the trees.

Red had waited at so many gates with Noc: underground cages, pack moot fires, hospital thresholds... and now this.

An altar in the heart of myth.

It hadn’t surprised him that Noc waited _for him_ at the end of the aisle. That was who he was. Brave. Fearless. Terrified of being loved but doing it anyway, because he couldn’t let the opportunity pass.

He didn’t cry during the vows.

Red didn’t let himself.

But now, standing with fingers still twined in Noc’s and the weight of the moment settling like dawn through the trees, the tears came quietly. Not many. Just enough.

Just enough to wash away the ghost of that silver cage.

---

**Aftermath**

Noc leaned into him. Still uncertain, sometimes. Still waiting for the catch. Red knew that look. It would take years to unteach the lie that love was conditional.

But he’d be there.

For every startled smile. Every night when Noc forgot how to sleep. Every time he woke up thinking claws were at the door. He’d be there, still.

Red wasn’t good with words, not the way Cahaliths were. But as he looked at his husband—_husband,_ fuck—he knew one thing in his marrow:

Noc had survived death.  
But more than that—he’d chosen to live.

And Red? He’d never stop choosing him in return.


**Nocturnal Miguel Rhaegis – After the Wedding**

He didn’t sleep that night.

Couldn’t.

The fire was low. The Realm didn’t need flames for warmth—it pulsed with some mythic heartbeat, ancient and watchful—but Noc still fed the embers, just to keep his hands busy.

Red was curled up nearby, breathing deep for once, one hand still reaching toward the empty space in the blankets where Noc should’ve been. That alone nearly broke him.

Because it meant _Red expected him to stay._

And Noc… Noc still didn’t know how to live like that.

---

**The Ghosts**

He had looked her in the eyes once. Maryska.

When she slit open another child for sport and dared him to feel.

When she ordered Maldaldo to tear apart a Garou cub while Noc stood chained to a pillar, screaming until his throat bled.

She’d said something to him then.

> “Even your grief is exquisite, little wolf.”

He’d carried that phrase like a curse.

Through his exile. Through the fights. Through the rain-slick blood of a hundred victories that never meant anything when he couldn’t save _anyone_ who actually mattered.

And then Libra died.

No. Was _taken._ Torn from this world and mailed to him like a joke.  
And whatever cracks were left in him from Romania—shattered.

He remembered none of it. Only Red’s face on the other side of silver bars, eyes rimmed in sleeplessness. Voice raw. No judgment. Just _stay with me._ Stay.

He almost hadn’t.

---

**The Vows**

And now he was married.

No chains. No cage. No test.

Just _Red,_ and the words he could barely say without choking on them.

> “I’ll stand by you.”

He hadn’t believed it until that moment, really. Not deep down.

But he did now.

Because Red _had._ Through the madness. Through the blood. Through the silences where Noc didn’t speak for days because the fear still strangled his throat.

Red never made him explain.  
Never made him feel wrong for surviving.

He just loved him. Fiercely. Quietly. Unconditionally.

Noc didn’t think he was loveable.

But Red had loved him anyway.

---

**Now**

He stood up from the fire. Slipped back under the blanket. Let Red's arm fall across his chest like a warding charm.

He wasn’t fixed.  
Wasn’t healed.  
Probably never would be.

But tonight?

He was _loved._

And for the first time in his brutal, blood-drenched life…  
That was enough.
