_(Age 18 – Walking Away for the Last Time)_

Miguel stepped out onto the front porch, suitcase gripped tight, the weight of his textbooks pressing down like **anchors to another world**. The air sat **heavy**, thick with humidity, clinging to his skin like something trying to pull him back.

He should’ve **just walked**. Should’ve never **looked**.

But he did.

The front door was still open behind him, swinging lazily in the evening breeze. Through it, the house sat **exposed**, stripped of shadows.

For the first time, Miguel **saw it**.

The peeling wallpaper, yellowed and curling at the edges. The **water stains** on the ceiling, mapping out old damage no one had ever fixed. The carpets, worn thin in places that told stories of **too many years spent pacing, sitting, waiting**.

His father sat slouched on the couch, beer can slick with condensation, resting against his knee like it belonged there. His shirt was stained, his posture slack, but his **eyes followed Miguel**, tracking him like a man watching something he can’t stop.

His mother sat at the kitchen table, cigarette between her fingers, gaze **far away, somewhere deep in the past**.

Not here.  
Not **ever** here.

The air tasted **stale**—cigarettes, sweat, beer, rot. The scent of a place **stuck in time**, refusing to shift, refusing to change.

And then Miguel understood. **Finally.**

This was **not home**.

It had never been home.

It was **just a house**, just a decaying structure where people happened to exist inside.

A **prison built from perception**, from memories warped by desperation, from years spent telling himself there was something here worth holding onto.

But there wasn’t.

And there never had been.

The realization settled deep—**too deep to unravel**, too final to argue.

Miguel didn’t say anything.

He didn’t step back inside.

He simply **turned**—stepping off the porch, down the cracked concrete sidewalk, into the humid night, suitcase in hand.

And **he did not stop walking**.
