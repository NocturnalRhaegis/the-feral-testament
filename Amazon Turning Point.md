The air was thick with heat and tension, machetes slicing paths through the green as Noc led the team with quiet warnings. He knew these lands. He remembered them—the trees held screams he hadn't yet told Red about. The mercs, all bark and bravado, mocked the reverence in his tone, eager to push forward.

Then, the village appeared: woven huts nestled in a clearing, watched over by the golden-eyed Balam. There was no violence, only wary calm.

An elder shaman stepped forward, his every move a ritual, his voice rising in ancient cadence. Noc felt it—something sacred blooming.

And then—

CRACK.

The shaman’s skull shattered mid-chant. Bone. Blood. Silence.

Then screams. Spears. Chaos.

“SNIPER!” Red roared, already dragging Noc down.

But it was too late.

The shooter—one of their own—had stayed behind. Hidden. Patient. He vanished into the jungle like a cowardly ghost, leaving ruin in his wake.

What followed was worse than violence. Quetzalcoatl descended.

Wind died. Color bled from the world as divine force coiled through the trees. Light shimmered into the form of a feathered serpent-god, radiating judgment.

Noc fell to his knees. Red followed.

“You bring death and dishonor. You trespass on blood-soaked land and murder its heart.”

The voice wasn’t sound. It was inside them.

The god searched their spirits. Judged. Weighed.

“The one who killed flees, and his fate will come. But you... you may choose.”

The mercenaries were struck dumb. Most fled in terror.

But Noc and Red stayed.

They remained behind for days, maybe weeks. They did not eat first. They did not sleep first. They worked—tending the wounded, digging graves for the shaman and the fallen, helping prepare the village for the mourning rites. Noc carried bodies he once would have fought. Red bound wounds in silence.

When night fell, they huddled together under the canopy, watching for the vengeful ghost of justice, but only the jungle answered.

On the seventh night, Noc sat beside a low fire, fingers caked in dirt and ash, his body sagging under the weight of what might have been.

Red nudged him. “We still breathing.”

Noc looked up. “Do you think that’s mercy? Or punishment?”

Red met his gaze, unwavering. “Maybe both. But we’re earning it.”

A beat passed.

Then Noc smiled, small and raw. “I think I’m glad you came.”

Red’s mouth twitched. “I think you’re stuck with me now.”

They didn’t need an oath. That night—the shame, the service, the blood—they bonded not in survival, but in shared atonement.

And from that point forward, there was no Noc or Red without the other.
