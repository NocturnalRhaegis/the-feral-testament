The abandoned garage hummed with a feral energy, the walls soaked in shadows as if the darkness itself were alive. Dust motes floated lazily in the shafts of moonlight that sliced through the grimy windows, cutting through the gloom in fractured streaks. Below, the underground ring where the fighters stood pulsed with tension—raw, animal, and dangerous. The air reeked of stale sweat and old blood, a scent that clung to everything like an unwelcome memory. Desperation lingered in the crowd, their eyes hungry, seeking release from lives tethered by fate’s cruel hand.

Noc, a man shaped by brutality and survival, stood at the heart of the chaos. His form, tall and broad, carried the weight of a life lived in the shadows. His eyes—obsidian pools—scanned the faces in the crowd with the cold precision of a predator, searching for weakness, for threat, for anything that might tip the balance. His presence alone was enough to silence the murmurs, a quiet menace that radiated from him like a storm waiting to break.

*Oceans apart, day after day*  
*And I slowly go insane*  
*I hear your voice on the line*  
*But it doesn't stop the pain*

*If I see you next to never*  
*Then how can we say forever?*

Across from him stood Red, younger, leaner, but no less dangerous. His body was marked by scars, trophies of battles fought and barely won, and his eyes held a defiant glint. Despite the beatings he'd endured, the punishment of countless rounds, there was still a fire in him—an ember that refused to die, even in the face of overwhelming odds. They circled each other, bodies coiled tight, senses razor-sharp. The wolf in each of them stirred beneath the surface, closer to breaking free with each step.

In the stifling heat of the room, Noc caught a scent that made his pulse stutter—a scent that didn’t belong to the damp, grimy humans packed around them like wolves circling prey. This was different. Sharp. Unmistakable. **Another werewolf**. A pulse of surprise shot through him. Red, too, caught it, his muscles tensing in recognition. The idea of facing another like them in a pit fight was unexpected, unorthodox.

*Wherever you go*  
*Whatever you do*  
*I will be right here waiting for you*  
*Whatever it takes*  
*Or how my heart breaks*  
*I will be right here waiting for you*

To Red, the thought felt wrong, twisted. This wasn’t a place for wolves to tear each other apart, not among the fragile bones of men. The human fighters below—driven to this dark world by desperation—were no match for the beasts they harbored within. Red wondered if Noc was rogue, a wolf who’d turned his back on the pack and embraced the savage brutality of the underground. Yet there was no malice in the scent—just survival. And Red, despite his wariness, sensed the same struggle, the same defiance against a world that wanted them chained, muzzled, and controlled.

The tension crackled between them, the room shrinking, their blood hot as the fight began. Flesh met flesh in an unholy symphony, fists landing with brutal precision, bones crunching like glass underfoot. The crowd roared with every strike, but to Noc and Red, they were ghosts. The only thing that existed was the other—two wolves locked in a battle not for dominance, but for understanding.

The fight stretched on, brutal, relentless, leaving both fighters bloodied, but not broken. Noc fought with a ferocity born of experience, of battles too numerous to count, but Red—he fought like a man with nothing to lose. In the end, it was Noc who stood victorious, breath heaving, fists clenched, but something had shifted. He saw in Red a reflection of himself—a kindred spirit trapped in a world that neither of them could fully escape.

*I took for granted, all the times*  
*That I thought would last somehow*  
*I hear the laughter, I taste the tears*  
*But I can't get near you now*

*Oh, can't you see it, baby?*  
*You've got me going crazy*

As the adrenaline faded, the distance between them melted away. What remained wasn’t just respect, but recognition—both outsiders, both marked by the same curse, and both searching for a place that didn’t exist.

Their camaraderie was unspoken at first, born in the silence that followed violence. Red’s wary defiance softened as he saw past Noc’s cold exterior, and Noc, in turn, began to trust what his instincts told him—that Red was more than just another fighter. They were survivors, and in a world that punished difference, they had found an ally.

Little did Noc know, Red’s feelings ran deeper than respect or friendship. As they fought side by side in the dark underbelly of the world, Red felt something he couldn’t ignore—an attraction that clawed at him, something raw and electric that had nothing to do with survival. He admired Noc’s strength, not just in his fists, but in the way he faced the world head-on, unyielding even as the weight of it bore down on him.

*Wherever you go*  
*Whatever you do*  
*I will be right here waiting for you*  
*Whatever it takes*  
*Or how my heart breaks*  
*I will be right here waiting for you*

But Noc was oblivious, his focus sharpened by the dangers that surrounded them, by the missions they took on together. To him, Red was a comrade-in-arms, a partner, someone he could trust when the stakes were high. The rest was just noise. Survival was all that mattered. At least, that’s what he told himself.

*I wonder how we can survive*  
*This romance*  
*But in the end if I'm with you*  
*I'll take the chance*

*Oh, can't you see it, baby?*  
*You've got me going crazy*

And so, under the cloak of night, their bond grew. The world above might have been drowning in light, but in the dark, in the places where shadows ruled, they found strength in each other. Together, they were unstoppable. Yet somewhere, hidden in the silence between their words, something deeper flickered—like a spark waiting for its moment to ignite.

A love that defied the odds was waiting. Neither knew it yet, but as they stood side by side in the midst of the storm, their connection would one day become the beacon that pierced through the black, guiding them through the darkness.

*Wherever you go*  
*Whatever you do*  
*I will be right here waiting for you*  
*Whatever it takes*  
*Or how my heart breaks*  
*I will be right here waiting for you*  
*Waiting for you*
