The tension in the air was palpable as Seras approached her father. Noc sat on the edge of his bed, elbows resting on his knees, hands clasped tightly together, staring blankly at the floor. He hadn't said much since their conversation about his past, and she knew why. He was ashamed—ashamed of the darkness he had revealed to her, ashamed of the scars, both physical and emotional, that he carried. She could see the weight of it pressing down on him, and it broke her heart.

*Made a wrong turn, once or twice*  
*Dug my way out, blood and fire*  
*Bad decisions, that's alright*  
*Welcome to my silly life*

"Hey," she said softly as she stepped into the room. Noc didn’t look up, but his posture stiffened slightly. Seras took a deep breath, feeling the awkwardness settle in her chest like a heavy stone. She had always looked up to her father, the strong, silent protector who never seemed to falter. But now, seeing him like this, so broken, was jarring.

"Are you okay?" she asked, even though she already knew the answer.

*Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood*  
*Miss knowing it's all good, it didn't slow me down*  
*Mistaken, always second guessing, underestimated*  
*Look, I'm still around*

Noc’s lips twitched into something that might have been a bitter smile, but it was fleeting. "I'm fine," he said quietly, his voice low and hoarse.

Seras frowned, stepping closer. "You don’t have to be fine, Dad. You don’t have to pretend with me."

For a long moment, Noc was silent. Then, he sighed deeply, his broad shoulders rising and falling as he finally spoke. "I shouldn’t have told you all that. I shouldn’t have burdened you with my past. I’m... I’m not who you think I am, Seras. You don’t know the kind of monster I am."

*You're so mean (you're so mean)*  
*When you talk (when you talk)*  
*About yourself, you were wrong*  
*Change the voices (change the voices)*  
*In your head (in your head)*  
*Make them like you instead*  
*So complicated, look happy, you'll make it*  
*Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game*  
*It's enough, I've done all I can think of*  
*Chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same, oh*

The word "monster" hung in the air between them, heavy and accusing. Seras felt a jolt of anger flare up inside her. She clenched her fists, trying to keep her composure, but the injustice of his self-loathing cut deep.

"Stop it," she said, her voice tight.

*Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel*  
*Like you're less than fuckin' perfect*  
*Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel like you're nothing*  
*You're fuckin' perfect to me*

Noc looked up at her, his eyes clouded with guilt and sorrow. "It’s true," he insisted. "You don’t understand. What Maryska did to me—what I became—it wasn’t just the wolf. It was... something worse. I’m not just a shifter, Seras. I’m... I’m ugly. Inside and out."

"Stop saying that!" Seras’s voice wavered, and she bit her lip to hold back the frustration. "You’re not ugly. You’re not a monster. You’re my father. You saved me. You raised me. Everything I am, it’s because of you."

Noc shook his head, his expression tortured. "You don’t know what I did—what I became when I was with her. I fought. I killed. I was an animal, an uncontrolled beast—"

"And you stopped," Seras interrupted, her tone fierce. "You escaped. You freed people. You never let the darkness consume you, Dad. That’s not what a monster does."

Noc’s breath caught, and for a moment, he looked away, as if he couldn’t bear to face her. Seras took a step closer, her voice softening, but no less determined.

*The whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear*  
*The only thing I should be drinking is an ice cold beer*  
*So cool in line, and we try, try, try*  
*But we try too hard and it's a waste of my time*  
*Done looking for the critics 'cause they're everywhere*  
*They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair*  
*Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time*  
*Why do we do that, why do I do that?*  
*Why do I do that?*

"You’ve always told me I was perfect just the way I am," she said, her words deliberate, each one striking with purpose. "Every time I doubted myself, every time I felt like I was too much—too strong, too wild—you were there to remind me that I didn’t have to apologize for who I am. That I’m whole. That I’m enough. And I believed you. I still believe you."

Noc’s brow furrowed, his lips parting as if he wanted to argue, but no words came.

"If I’m perfect just the way I am," Seras continued, her voice rising with conviction, "then so are you. You have to be, because I am your daughter. I carry the beast too, and you taught me that I don’t have to be afraid of it. That I don’t have to be ashamed of what I am. If that’s true for me, then it’s true for you too."

*Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel*  
*Like you're less than fuckin' perfect*  
*Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel like you're nothing*  
*You're fuckin' perfect to me*

Noc’s chest heaved with emotion, and Seras could see the struggle in his eyes—the battle between years of self-hatred and the love she was trying to remind him of. He had spent so long believing he was a monster, a creature twisted by his past, that he had forgotten the man he truly was.

"Dad," she said softly, stepping forward and placing her hand on his. "You’re not a monster. You’re a survivor. You’re my father. And you’re perfect just the way you are."

For a long moment, Noc didn’t move. He sat there, staring at their joined hands, as if the words she had spoken were too much to process. His breathing was shallow, and Seras could see the tears he refused to shed building in his eyes.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Noc’s shoulders sagged, and he let out a long, shaky breath. His hand tightened around hers, and for the first time in what felt like years, a small, almost imperceptible smile tugged at the corner of his mouth.

"Seras," he whispered, his voice thick with emotion.

She smiled back at him, her heart swelling with love for the man who had always been her rock, even when he couldn’t see it himself.

"You’ve always been enough," she said softly. "And you always will be."

*Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel*  
*Like you're less than fuckin' perfect*  
*Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel like you're nothing*  
*You're fuckin' perfect to me*

*Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel like you're nothing*  
*You're fuckin' perfect to me*

Noc swallowed hard, his throat bobbing with the effort to keep his composure. He squeezed her hand, a silent acknowledgment that maybe, just maybe, she was right. He wasn’t a monster. Not to her. Not to anyone who mattered.

And for the first time in a long time, Noc allowed himself to believe it.
