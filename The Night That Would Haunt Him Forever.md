### **The First Kill**

_He was seventeen. Noc never forgot that. Not once. Not in forty years._

He’d been starved for three days.  
No blood. No light. No voice except hers, murmuring through the stone walls like a lullaby made of rusted knives.

When he tried to shift back to human, the collar scorched his spine.  
When he refused to eat, she laughed and whispered, _“Soon.”_

And when the cell door finally opened—

**he ran.**

Instinct. Terror. Something primal surging through ruined nerves.

But it wasn’t freedom.

It was the arena.

Stone floor. Salt-soaked walls. A viewing balcony with her silhouette leaned forward like a theatre patron breathless at opening night.

And in the center of the chamber—  
a boy.

**Seventeen.**

He was shaking so hard the sword in his hand rattled.

Miguel—_Nocturnal_—froze. His claws scraped stone. His breath steamed the air. The wolf inside him snarled, but it wasn’t rage. It was hunger.

The boy looked up. Pale eyes. Freckled cheeks. Tears.

**“Please,”** he whispered. “_I don’t want to—_”

And then the doors slammed shut behind them.

It wasn’t a choice. It was a _sentence._

Maryska’s voice slithered down from the shadows.

> “One of you walks out. You decide which.”

He could feel her eyes on him. Not with hatred.

With **expectation.**

Like this was the moment she’d been waiting for.

And deep, _deep_ in Noc’s gut—something responded.

Not _will_.  
Not _consent_.  
Just the simple animal truth:

**Eat. Or die.**

The boy swung first. Screamed as he did. It wasn’t skill. It wasn’t rage. It was desperation.

The blade grazed fur, nicked his shoulder.

That’s all it took.

The wolf didn’t think. It _moved._

Faster than it should’ve.

Teeth found flesh. Claws tore.

There was blood—_so much blood_—and it was warm and it was screaming and it was **his** and he couldn’t stop—

He didn’t remember the moment Alexander stopped fighting.

Only the _after._

The sound of dripping.  
The copper taste.  
The quiet.

And her voice.

> “Beautiful.”

He dropped to the floor, mouth slick with guilt and gore, eyes wide and human again.

**Seventeen.**  
He was seventeen.

Noc reached out with trembling fingers, touched the boy’s cheek.

Still warm.

Still _real._

And that was the moment something _broke._

He’d believed he was cursed. That something in him was always waiting to erupt. That _this_ was why the world punished him. That he’d been born wrong, and now Maryska had _proof_.

He’d taken a life.

He’d torn a child apart.

And the worst part—

The very worst part—

Was that some part of him  
**felt alive.**

---

He would spend the next four decades trying to bleed that feeling out of himself.

Through discipline. Through battle. Through every act of service that might atone.

But no matter what he did,  
no matter who he saved,  
no matter how much blood he spilled to protect others—

Alexander’s name was always the first he whispered when the nightmares came.
