The First Kill  
He was seventeen.  
Noc never forgot that. Not once. Not in forty years. Not when the blood washed off. Not when the  
nightmares came. Not even when he held Red in his arms and felt the pulse of something sacred.  
Because before there was love—  
There was this.  
They hadn't fed him in three days.  
Not blood. Not water. Not even hope.  
Just darkness, and her voice—sweet and rotted—leaking through the cracks in the stone like poison gas.  
"You're special," she cooed.  
"You're chosen."  
"You'll be glorious."  
And every syllable sliced deeper than starvation ever could.  
The collar seared his spine every time he tried to shift down. It wasn't just pain—it was punishment, a  
reminder: the flesh is not yours anymore.  
When he refused the raw meat they slid through the grate, she laughed. Not cruelly. Lovingly. Like a mother  
watching her child throw a tantrum before bedtime.  
"Soon."  
And when the door opened—  
He ran.  
Instinct. Terror. A snapped leash.  
His body didn't ask questions—it bolted, blind and bloody-footed, lungs shredding in his chest. But there  
was no freedom, only the end of the hallway—  
A chamber.  
Salt-stone walls. A floor slick with old stains.

Above, a balcony draped in velvet and shadow.  
Her silhouette leaning forward, hands folded, as if waiting for curtain rise.  
And at the center of the arena—  
A boy.  
Seventeen. Maybe younger. No scars, no growl.  
He was holding a sword like it weighed more than his soul.  
Pale eyes. Freckled cheeks. Cheeks that probably still dimpled when he smiled. Not that he was smiling now.  
His mouth was trembling. His whole body trembled.  
He was crying.  
"Please," the boy whispered, sword rattling. "I don't want to—"  
The doors slammed behind them like thunder.  
No way out.  
No way back.  
Above them, Maryska's voice slithered like oil on water:  
"One of you walks out. You decide which."  
That was the moment everything stopped.  
No mercy. No time. No sanity.  
Just that one sentence and a silence that screamed.  
Noc looked at the boy. He didn't see a threat.  
He saw himself.  
And it didn't matter.  
Because something deep inside—something ancient and ruined—rose up and whispered back:  
Eat. Or die.  
He wanted to scream. To run. To bargain.  
But the wolf didn't care.
