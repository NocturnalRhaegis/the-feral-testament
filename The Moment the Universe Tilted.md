_(Noc & Red—An Underground Fight That Was Never Just a Fight)_

The abandoned garage **hummed with tension**, the walls slick with shadow, as if the darkness itself had a heartbeat. Dust drifted in the shafts of moonlight **like waiting ghosts**, slicing through the grime-covered windows in fractured streaks.

Below, the **pit** pulsed with something **raw**, **animal**, **unspoken**—a place where desperation met violence, where men fought for survival, for coin, for proof that they still **existed**.

And in the center of it, **Nocturnal Rhaegis stood alone**.

His presence was a storm contained, a quiet menace **etched into the cut of his posture**, the **steady scan of his obsidian-dark gaze**. He did not need to speak to **command the silence**—he was threat enough **simply by standing there**.

Across from him, **Red**.

Younger. Leaner. But dangerous in the way survivors always were.

Scars **etched across his skin**, tattoos whispering stories he never told. His stance was sharp, coiled, **ready**—but beneath it, beneath the tension **that always existed before the first strike**, something **shifted**.

Recognition.

Not familiarity.

Not even understanding.

Just **a pull—something unshaken, something inevitable.**

And then—Noc **caught the scent**.

It **hit him** like ice in the lungs.

Not sweat. Not blood. Not the reek of human bodies packed together like predators waiting for the kill.

This was different. **Sharp. Unmistakable.**

**Another werewolf.**

His pulse **stuttered**.

Red’s **stiffened**.

That instinct, that knowing—**two wolves recognizing their own**.

Red spoke first. **“You’re wasting yourself in here.”**

Noc didn’t blink. **“And you aren’t?”**

The crowd blurred—nothing but **a distant haze**, just noise in the backdrop of a moment **that had already changed them**.

Then the fight began.

Flesh met flesh, not just **for dominance**, not just **for survival**, but for **something unspoken**.

Neither of them held back.

Neither of them **needed to**.

This wasn’t about **winning**—it was about **knowing**.

About **testing the weight of each other’s existence**.

The fight lasted too long. **Neither broke. Neither yielded.** But in the end, it was Noc **who stood last**.

Breath heaving. Blood on his knuckles.

And Red—watching him like he’d found something **worth knowing**.

Something **worth following**.

The silence stretched long **before it cracked**.

Red let out a slow, quiet exhale. **"You fight like a man who doesn’t know how to lose."**

Noc tilted his head, gaze still sharp, still assessing. **"You fight like a man who doesn’t care if he does."**

A beat.

And then—**everything settled.**

What began in fists **ended in knowing**.

Not friendship. Not camaraderie.

Something **deeper**.

Something **more dangerous**.

Something Noc never **expected**, never **wanted**, but now **couldn’t stop from shifting the course of his world.**

And **Red**?

Red **had already decided**.

Not just tonight.

Not just this fight.

But for **everything that would come after.**
