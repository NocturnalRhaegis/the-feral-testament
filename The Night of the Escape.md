_(September 19, 2015 – Kozilek Watches, Knowing He’s Part of Something Bigger)_

The fortress was **too quiet**, but Kozilek had learned long ago—quiet meant movement. Quiet meant decisions being made in the dark. **Quiet meant someone was about to bleed.**

And tonight?

Tonight, someone **was walking out of here alive** when they weren’t supposed to.

He lingered in the corridor, posture loose, hands in his pockets, every inch of him projecting **calculated disinterest**. But beneath the surface, he was watching. **Dissecting. Memorizing.**

Kozilek had spent weeks **tracking Nocturnal Rhaegis**, learning his movements, studying Maryshka’s twisted fascination with the boy.

Not because he cared.

Because it was **too neat.**

Something was **off**, something beneath the surface.

This wasn’t just **another pet project of Maryshka’s**, wasn’t just another **prisoner she delighted in breaking.**

Nocturnal wasn’t breaking. **Not fully. Not the way he should have.**

And that was **why Kozilek was here**.

Not because Fisk sent him.

Because someone else had.

Someone **Fisk listened to**.

Someone **who had orchestrated this from a distance, long before Kozilek had stepped foot in this place**.

But Kozilek still didn’t have a name.

That was what unsettled him most.

Because he had **never worked in shadows he didn’t recognize.**

Until now.

The **gate groaned open**, the stolen key scraping metal, the sound **far too loud** in the brittle silence.

**And then—the howl.**

Werewolves.

Kozilek stepped forward.

Just **slightly**.

Just **enough**.

The vampires hesitated.

It wasn’t noticeable. **It wasn’t supposed to be.**

Just a flicker in the rhythm of pursuit, a half-second delay **where there shouldn’t have been one**.

Enough for them to get away.

Enough for Maryshka to realize, just a **fraction of a second too late**, that **her favorite had slipped through her fingers**.

The fortress exploded with sound.

Alarms, footsteps, orders being barked—chaos **rolling through the walls like a sickness.**

Kozilek leaned against the stone, exhaling slow.

Maryshka was **furious**.

Good.

He had done **exactly what was expected**.

Even if he still didn’t know **who expected it.**

And Rhaegis?

He had no idea Kozilek had **been there at all**.

Not **yet**.

But **one day**, he would.

And when he did?

It was going to be **a hell of a reckoning**.
