The world outside was bright. Too bright. It stabbed at their eyes like truth after too many lies. Noc and Red staggered out the rusted metal door, breath ragged, blood-soaked, silver-burned—but free.

For now.

Then came the sound. Boots. Thirty pairs. Crunching gravel. Chainmail clinking. The air thickened with the weight of drawn blades and cocked rifles. The kind of men who didn’t hesitate. Monster-killers, every one of them. Sent to bring legends to heel.

They formed a circle, weapons raised, eyes cold.

Noc and Red stood back-to-back, both swaying on their feet, their bodies so battered they could barely raise their fists—but gods, did they try. It wasn’t bravery. It wasn’t stubbornness. It was love, and it was fury, and it was the unspoken agreement that they would not go quietly.

Red’s voice was low, and calm. “Got one more dance in you?”

Noc grinned, lip split and bleeding. “If I fall, fall with me.”

“I always do.”

Then the circle began to close.

That’s when the world... shifted.

The ground hummed beneath their feet. The wind stilled, as if holding its breath. And then—light. Not golden, not bright—alive. Green and ancient and vast. It poured through the cracks of the world like something waking up from a long sleep, angry at what had been done in its absence.

The men froze.

A sound rose in the air, not a roar, not a whisper—something older. Like roots groaning beneath stone. Like thunder shaking in bone marrow.

And then—they were gone.

Vanished.

Snatched from death’s edge like wolves from the jaws of a trap.

They landed hard in soft earth, surrounded by startled gasps. Campfires. Tents. Family.

Oula dropped her blade mid-motion. Cobalt’s arms spread wide in disbelief. Delphine’s eyes filled like storm-pools. Their warriors had been moments from mounting a suicidal rescue mission—and now the wolves had returned.

Noc groaned, blinked up at the sun through the leaves, and whispered, “Did we die?”

Red rolled onto his side, coughing blood and laughter. “Guess Gaia said no.”

Oula was the first to reach them, kneeling between their broken bodies.

“You look like hell,” she said, trying to sound casual, but her voice cracked.

“We lived in worse,” Noc croaked, gripping her forearm. “But I’ll take the upgrade.”

Behind them, the wind stirred again, and the scent of wildflowers bloomed out of nowhere.

Gaia’s mark.

Not just survivors.

Chosen.
