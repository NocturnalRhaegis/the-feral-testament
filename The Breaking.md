The Breaking: Noc's Captive Years (2005–2007)

“They didn’t need a decade. Just a collar, a pit, and a hunger.”

March 30, 2005 – Day Zero

The jungle breathes hot and wet. Mosquitos hum like distant saws. You're in the Amazon, tracking genetic anomalies in tribal DNA, chasing a way to help Xavier live longer. Then she finds you.

Maryska. Toreador. Beautiful like a knife.

She doesn’t ask. She bites.

She leaves you half-dead under moonlight, veins screaming, body rearranging in impossible ways. Alone. Screaming. The first Change ignites—and you burn into existence as something else.

You think that was the worst day of your life.

It wasn't.

Week 1 – The Collar

You're dragged from the jungle, still feral, by strangers in latex and silver. They call her Mistress.

They put the collar on.

It’s not just silver. It’s enchanted. It learns your mind.

It floods you with echo loops—the moment you first killed, the scream of Alexander, over and over.

When you sleep, it replays your father’s voice.

When you resist, it pulses guilt, fury, betrayal.

When you try to forget, it reminds you of Xavier.

You are no longer Noc.

You are now Subject 42B: Garou (combat viable).

Month 1–3 – The Arena

The first fight is a blur.

You're starving. They throw in something smaller than you—some hybrid shifter guy. You try to hold back. The collar punishes hesitation.

You kill him.

Then her.

Then three at once.

You learn what it means to die over and over without actually dying.

Pain becomes punctuation.

Breath becomes rationed.

They don’t let you heal completely. They time your regeneration, inflict wounds just before they seal. They record everything. Maryska watches. She calls it art.

You start counting deaths. You lose count after 40.

Month 4–9 – The Beast Emerges

You’re no longer the MIT prodigy. You’ve stopped thinking in English.

You grunt. You bite.

You exist to be fed and feared.

Some vampires bet on you.

Others worship you.

Others... try to break you.

You are leased out to other rings. Bucharest. Munich. Bangkok.

They rename you:

The Beast. The Collar-hound. Silverfire.

You are drugged with wyrmtainted adrenaline cocktails.

You tear apart a BSD half your size. The crowd cheers.

You vomit in your corner. No one notices.

You kill Alexander, age 17. A boy who should've been your brother. He begged. You didn't have a choice. The collar didn't care.

You scream his name for weeks. It echoes in the silver. It scars you deeper than claws.

Month 10–18 – Lucidity Breaks

You begin losing time.

You wake up bloodied. Screaming. Alone.

You forget your name.

The collar amplifies shame. You relive memories of your mother ignoring your cries, your father's belt, the moment you left Xavier behind.

You cry in your sleep.

You kill while crying.

Final Months – The Turn

You begin to fake compliance.

You learn the ring schedules.

You whisper to a vampire assistant who thinks you’re already broken. You give him what he wants: tears. Regret. Vulnerability.

He gives you something back: a map.

You’re thrown into a high-stakes match in a marble coliseum in Greece. The audience is rich. Old. Arrogant.

You see Kozilek in the crowd. You don’t know him—but he’s there.

You snap the collar’s lock with a borrowed silver key. It sears your hand down to the tendon.

You rip the head off your opponent and keep going.

Blood rains like wine. Screams echo.

You vanish in the chaos.

End of 2007 – Escape to Ash

You return to Los Alamos naked, broken, and radioactive with rage.

Parents slam the door. Xavier is gone—no forwarding address.

You sleep in alleyways. You fight in back alleys.

Then—Red.

17. Reckless. Refusing to fall.

Something about him cracks the last of your rage-cage.

You spare him. Feed him.

You don’t know why you let him stay.

He never leaves.

Epilogue: Why It Worked

It wasn't the time.

It was the design.

They engineered you like a curse:

Magical collar looping trauma

Psychological feedback to amplify suffering

Daily death without release

Garou memory that refuses to forget

Three years.

More than enough to unmake a man.

And just enough to reforge him.
