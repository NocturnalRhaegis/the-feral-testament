Timeframe: Post-wedding, shortly after Maryska’s final defeat. Location: Caern, Noc’s private quarters.

The night was quiet, deceptively so. The kind of stillness that’s too deep, too settled. Red had taken the younger pups for a late run, giving Noc a rare hour to brood in peace. He sat in his den, floor scattered with old pit-fight trophies, cracked relics of a past he still wasn’t sure how to forgive.

The door creaked.

Karma stepped inside—usually bold, fiery-eyed, unbothered by rank or ritual. But not tonight. Tonight she moved like someone carrying a relic soaked in god-blood. She held a small digital drive in one hand, wrapped in a handkerchief as though it might bite.

Noc looked up, brow furrowed. “Someone die?”

“No,” she said quietly, “but someone’s about to be reborn.”

He straightened, tension bleeding into his shoulders. “You’re being cryptic. That’s my job.”

Karma crossed the floor and knelt in front of him. That alone was enough to gut him—Apis rarely bowed to anyone.

She offered the drive.

“I cracked the Blacksite files. The ones from Maryska’s final lab. There was a genome folder... on Seras.”

Noc flinched. He’d seen enough horrors coded into helixes to know what that meant. “What did she do to her?”

Karma shook her head. “It’s not what she did. It’s what you and Red did.”

Noc blinked. “The hell does that mean?”

Karma exhaled. “Maryska used your DNA. Both of yours. Spliced them. Ran growth trials on manipulated zygotes. Most failed. One didn’t.”

Noc stared.

Karma’s voice broke, softer now. “Seras isn’t just your daughter because you found her. She’s your daughter because you made her. You and Red. She is flesh of your flesh.”

Silence thundered through the room.

Noc didn’t move. Didn’t breathe. He just stared at the drive in her palm like it was the beating heart of some ancient god, torn from its chest and offered to him still warm.

Thirty years. Thirty years he’d lived with the quiet grief that he would never hold a child of his blood. Thirty years of telling himself he didn’t deserve to. That the Wyrm had clawed that future out of his hands the moment his bones first cracked in a rage-shift under a full moon.

And now…

A soft sound escaped him. A laugh, broken and ragged, twisted around the edges with disbelief and something dangerously close to joy.

“She’s mine?” he whispered. “Not just by oath, but by birth?”

Karma nodded, eyes shimmering.

Noc stood slowly. His hands trembled as he took the drive, holding it like a relic, like it might vanish if he looked away. Then his knees buckled, and he sank to the ground.

He didn’t cry like a man. He cried like a storm breaking over the mountains.

Red returned minutes later, sensing the rupture in their bond like a tether gone taut. He found Noc on the floor, Karma at his side, the two of them cradling a truth neither expected.

“What happened?” Red asked, rushing forward.

Noc looked up, face streaked with tears and wonder. “She’s ours,” he choked. “Seras… she’s ours.”

Red’s breath caught. And then he was on his knees too, pulling Noc into his arms, their foreheads pressed together like a prayer.

And somewhere deep in the Caern, beneath root and soil, Gaia exhaled.

Her son had come home.

Red’s POV: The Revelation

The moment Karma said “you should sit down,” Red knew something was about to tear his world open.

But he didn’t sit. He never does. Not when it counts.

The air in the room felt too still, like the world had stopped breathing. Karma laid the datapad on the table like it was a holy relic—or a live grenade. She looked at him with reverence and apology mixed like oil and blood.

“She’s yours,” Karma said. “Yours and Noc’s. She’s… she’s your daughter.”

Red didn’t flinch. Not at first. His hands didn’t tremble. His jaw didn’t drop. He just stood there, staring down at the screen like it might bite him.

DNA overlays. Ident markers. Cellular drift. Signatures of both him and Noc in every double helix of the child they’d raised, loved, protected for decades.

Seras.

Their Seras.

The world tilted.

He remembered her first words. Her first punch. The first time she called Noc “Dad” in that begrudging, I'm-not-crying-you’re-crying way. The way she used to fall asleep in Red’s lap while he sharpened his blades, the little snores that meant she felt safe, even back then.

She was already his. Already Noc’s. But this…

This made it blood. This made it soul.

Red backed away from the table like it was on fire. Not because he didn’t want it. But because the weight of it might shatter him if he let it all in at once.

He ran a hand over his face, dragging emotion out through his skin. And then—then he laughed. A short, incredulous thing. The kind of laugh you make when you find light in a cave you were sure was endless.

All this time, he thought Noc had given up the dream of being a father.

But the Wyrm lost.

The Wyrm lost.

They had a daughter. A miracle in the wreckage. A phoenix from ash and horror and all the things Maryska tried to destroy.

Red turned away from the screen, from Karma, from the data.

He needed to find Noc.

Because tonight, for the first time in years, Red Knight was going to cry. And not from pain.

But from joy.
