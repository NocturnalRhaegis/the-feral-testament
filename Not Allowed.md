[Verse 1]
There was laughter once—
Golden light, their pride in me
Said I was brilliant, quick and bright
Before love forgot how to be

Then the silence started cracking
Phone calls, vodka breath and lies
Mom in bed for weeks on end
Dad with thunder in his eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
I still remember
When she stopped looking up
When Xavier kicked
And she just gave up
I was a shadow
In a shrinking home
Learning young
That I’d be alone

[Chorus]
I’m not allowed to scream
Not allowed to cry
Not allowed to ask
Just stay small and lie
Not allowed to break
Even when I bleed
So I held my breath
Till the panic seized me

Seven years old
With a war in my chest
Monsters with faces
That once meant rest

[Verse 2]
He tried to die
Silent crib, no breath, just black
And I was there
Wishing I could take it back

Dad hit walls,
Mom stared through me
Rage lived under skin
Where love used to be

[Bridge] (half-sung, intense)
Six years later—
Hospital lights
Xav can’t breathe
I’m not old enough to fight

“No adults, no entry,”
They made me wait
Like love had rules
And I was too late

Sat in the hallway
Fists clenched tight
Too young to help
Too wrong to be right

[Breakdown]
Tell me again how I turned out fine
When all I knew of love was crossing lines
I cough up grief like static air
Still choking on things no one cared to hear

[Final Chorus]
Wasn’t allowed to scream
So now I roar
Wasn’t allowed to cry
So now I pour
Everything I am
Into fists and fire
A child forged
In unanswered desire

I wasn’t allowed in
To say goodbye
So I carry the weight
Of that silent cry

I loved him so loud
But they made me small—
And I’ve been trying to breathe
Ever since that hall

[Outro] (whispered / gentle delivery)
If I’d been older,
Maybe they’d have let me try
But I was just a kid…
So I watched him
Almost
Die
