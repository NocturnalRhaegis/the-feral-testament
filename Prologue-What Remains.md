There are nights I dream of laying it all down. The weapons. The war. The weight of being needed.

In the dark, I imagine a world where I’m just a man—no scars, no claws, no one calling my name like I’m the last wall between them and annihilation. Just silence. Just peace. Just breath.

Then the sun rises. And peace dies with it.

I lead a Caern that shouldn’t exist—a bastion of unity in a world addicted to division. Not because I believe in peace. Because I’m tired of digging graves for the same damn war.

They call me Nocturnal. A name that clings like blood to bone. It wasn’t the one I was born with. That name belonged to someone else—a boy with sharp eyes and too many books, who thought he could save his brother with gene therapy and dreams.

Miguel Rhaegis died in the jungle. Nocturnal crawled out of it.

There’s a kind of alchemy in trauma. You don’t just survive it. You transform.

Once, I hesitated before I killed. Now? My hands know the weight of necks and the silence that follows. Once, I avoided conflict. Now I train children how to win them. Once, I dreamed of curing disease. Now I wage war against it—with steel, and spirit, and fury.

Don’t mistake this for strength. It’s just adaptation. A scar is only skin learning how not to bleed.

Red Knight tells me I’m still human underneath it all. That I haven’t lost the boy I was. But he didn’t see what Dragomir made of me. What Maryska unleashed. He doesn’t hear the teeth behind my silence. Doesn’t feel the beast in my prayers.

But he stays. He stays, and that’s enough to keep me trying.

Maybe that’s all we are now—monsters who refuse to stop hoping. Maybe hope’s the bravest thing left.
