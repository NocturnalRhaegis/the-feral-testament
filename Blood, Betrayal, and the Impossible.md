_(The jungle never forgets. Neither does she.)_

Miguel had been alone for **eight days**, surviving on stale coffee and sheer **obsession**.

The research site was little more than a patch of clearing tucked beneath the jungle’s suffocating canopy—mosquito-infested, drenched in humidity, with the scent of damp earth clinging to everything.

He had no team. **Teams cost money.**

So he worked alone.

Every blood test, every note scribbled into the battered leather journal by the dim light of his lantern.

The locals **had warned him**, shaking their heads when he refused to leave with them, their voices thick with unease.

_"Dark things walk when the moon is full."_

He had dismissed it. Superstition. Folklore.

Then **they left**, abandoning the research station, taking their supplies, their laughter, their presence—**everything except the warning.**

And that night, as he stood beneath the dripping jungle canopy, washing sweat from his face near the firepit, **she arrived.**

A shadow.

Nothing more than **a specter watching from the rock outcropping**, silent, patient, **waiting**.

Not for him.

For **the bloodshed.**

It came quickly.

Maldaldo **wasn’t sloppy**.

The Glasswalker struck **precisely**, claws raking through flesh, tearing muscle, severing tendon **like a surgeon of brutality**.

Miguel never saw him coming—just the **sudden force**, the crackle of bone, the wet heat of his own blood spilling onto jungle soil.

He hit the ground. Hard.

Vision blackened at the edges, the stars obliterated by thick canopy.

The pain came next.

Blinding. Unrelenting.

MIguel tried to breathe.

But **something inside him was breaking. Something was changing.**

She watched.

She did not intervene.

She did not speak.

She simply **waited.**

Because no one survived the bite.

No one.

### **The Silver Collar — A Promise of Suffering**

_Survival was a mistake. She intends to correct it._

The jungle was still now.

No more screams.  
No more howling.  
Just _him_—a collapsed miracle sprawled in the blood-wet moss, breath hitching in uneven fragments, fur matted and steaming from the agony of rebirth.

She crouched beside him, long coat brushing the dirt, predator made queen. A silhouette against the moon-stitched canopy.

His body had burned itself out. Every tendon, every nerve ending, every thread of his soul had been ripped apart and re-woven by forces older than reason. It should’ve killed him.

It always did.

And yet.

She tilted her head, gaze flicking over his trembling limbs with a fascination that bordered on reverence. "Miguel," she murmured, voice rich with the lullaby cadence of someone admiring the bloom of a rare, poisonous flower.

He didn’t answer.

He _couldn’t_.

The transformation had stolen his voice, his strength—his humanity.

She reached out, brushing a gloved fingertip across the sharp edge of his jaw, where wolf and man still warred beneath the surface.

Blood steamed beneath her hand. His blood.

Still hot.

Still alive.

"Do you know what you’ve done?" she whispered, voice wrapped in velvet and threat. Not cruel. Not gentle. Just _curious_—the same way a surgeon might admire the twitch of muscle beneath a blade.

"You survived."

A pause, a breath.

"No one survives."

A faint smile touched her lips, carved from something far older than joy. She slid a hand into her coat and drew it out again, holding something small, something wicked.

A silver collar.

Gleaming. Perfect. Made for _him_.

"So now I need to know..." she said.

The _snick_ of the clasp was quiet. But it rang like a gunshot in the hollow of his mind.

He flinched as it closed around his throat. His body jerked instinctively, the silver burning into new flesh. Smoke curled up like incense from where it bit down.

She smiled wider. "…what will break you?"

Her fingers ghosted along the curve of the metal, tracing it like a lover’s promise. The jungle whispered around them—wind rustling through leaves, insects chirping like distant clockwork—but no answers came.

"You’ll fight them, you know. My best. My darlings. My monsters," she said, crouching lower, her voice a seductive razor. “You’ll win… or you won’t.”

Her eyes glittered, inhuman and hungry.

"And I’ll be watching. Every. Time."

Another soft tug on the collar. Not to restrain—just to _remind_.

"And when that last part of you finally splinters, when the fire in your eyes gutters out like the last breath of a dying star…" she leaned close, her lips brushing fur, “…then I’ll know. I’ll know I’ve found the limit of something extraordinary.”

His eyelids fluttered. Consciousness slipped like water through a cracked vessel. His breath slowed. His limbs sagged. The darkness came, and with it, silence.

She didn't stop it.

She just watched, patiently.

Like an artist savoring the final brushstroke.

The jungle exhaled. The moment held.

And somewhere beneath that canopy of gods and ghosts, a miracle of fury and flesh fell asleep in chains—while the monster who made him plotted how to tear him apart.
