**Red Knight – When the Light Went Out**

It started with a box.

Heavy. Plain. Delivered in the rain like something casual, like something normal.

He didn’t open it right away. He knew. The moment his hands touched the cardboard, slick with water and something else, he knew.

Libra.  
Gods, Libra.

Her scent was gone. That soft steadiness she always carried, the subtle grace of her presence in the caern, was just—gone. And when the box was opened—when that sight met his eyes—he didn’t scream. Not at first.

He turned toward the main hall, carrying the box like it was made of fire, and told them not to let Noc see it.

They failed.

And the light went out.

**The Madness**

Red had seen Noc angry before. Had seen him bloodied, battered, enraged, even feral. But he’d never seen him _empty._

This was different.

This wasn’t rage. This was absence.

Noc didn’t speak. Didn’t sleep. Didn’t eat. He stood for hours at the cliff's edge, his hands trembling, not from fear—but from something deeper. Something unraveling. When Red touched his shoulder, Noc flinched like a wounded animal, and his eyes—

They weren’t Noc’s.

Not the man Red had fought beside in underground rings.  
Not the boy who refused to die in the jungle.  
Not the guardian who’d taken in every lost soul who wandered too far from Gaia’s light.

He was _gone._

The worst part? Red could feel the wrongness. The supernatural twist of it. Something—_someone_—had found a way inside Noc’s mind, cracked it open, and let all the old horrors pour back in. Not just Libra’s death. All of it. Romania. The cages. The nights when the only sound was a crowd screaming for blood.

It broke him.

So they caged him—silver bars, reinforced cell, warded from within and without. And still, every night, Red would hear the scraping of claws. The howl muffled by stone. The whimpering.

They said it was the only way to keep him safe.

Red didn’t sleep for thirteen days.

**The Waiting**

Red buried Libra with his own hands. Said the rites himself. There wasn’t time to grieve—not properly. The rest of the pack needed leadership. The caern needed protection. And Noc—_Noc needed saving._

But gods... the silence of that room.

He visited every day. Sat just outside the bars and talked like Noc could still hear him.

He told him stories. Some funny. Some dark. He recounted the first fight they ever won together, when Noc punched a Get of Fenris so hard his tooth left a dent in the concrete. He told him about the time he nearly kissed him during a blackout, and how grateful he was that Noc had been too dazed to notice.

He begged him to come back.

Red wasn’t afraid of dying. Not really. He was afraid of watching Noc forget how to _live._

**The Return**

It wasn’t a miracle. It was work.

Charlotte. Sam. Cleo. They put their heads together, followed the threads of Vecna’s dark web, and untangled the metaphysical roots of the curse. It wasn’t just grief. It was _sabotage._ An engineered, surgical strike at the mind of one of Gaia’s deadliest warriors.

They found a way to undo it.

There was a ritual. A risk. But they took it.

And when Noc finally looked up—_really_ looked up—and Red saw his eyes again... the relief nearly killed him.

He didn’t cry until later. Quietly. Alone. Back to a wall and fists clenched in his jacket. Because you don’t weep in front of a recovering wolf. You stand. You smile. You wait.

And when it’s safe—_then_ you fall apart.

**He Didn’t Say It Then**

He didn’t say _I love you_ in the cell.

He didn’t say it after Libra came back.

He didn’t say it when Noc stumbled out of the cage with bruises beneath his skin and a thousand-yard stare.

But he _did_ say:

“I knew you’d find your way back.”

And later, much later, Noc would whisper that it was those words—just those—that had anchored him to himself.
