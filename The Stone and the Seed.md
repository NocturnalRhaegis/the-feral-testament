[Verse 1]
I walk where the wild things weep
Through the hush where the roots run deep
My hands bear callus, blood, and grace
A shield for those who leave no trace

[Verse 2]
I’ve stood where the green turns gray
Held the line when hope gave way
Not for glory, not for name
But for the fire I cannot tame

[Chorus]
I am the stone, I am the seed
The silent vow, the unheard plea
Where others break, I rise and bleed
Not out of hate, but love’s decree

[Verse 3]
Beneath my calm, the storm still grows
A garden no one ever knows
I’ve swallowed grief, I’ve buried rage
And turned them into sacred blade

[Chorus repeat]
I am the stone, I am the seed
The silent vow, the unheard plea
Where others break, I rise and bleed
Not out of hate, but love’s decree

[Spoken Bridge – solemn tone]
“I do not strike in anger.
I do not guard for reward.
My blade is not for conquest,
But for the breath between heartbeats.
I am the stillness before the storm,
The root beneath the ruin.
I serve not command, but calling—
And my soul is bound to the green.”

[Final Chorus – soft/echoed]
I am the stone, I am the seed
The sacred hush beneath the trees
Where shadows fall and hearts recede
I rise. I stand. I choose to be.
