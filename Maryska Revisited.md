ðŸ©¸ **Scene: "Statement for the Council"**

**Location:** London, deep in the Elysium of the European Vampire Councilâ€”the sitting room of the Toreador Primogen. Velvet walls, incense-thick air, and centuries of stolen beauty. Art by tortured hands watches from gilded frames.

Noc sits comfortably on an ornate settee, his own thermos of tea in handâ€”a small act of normalcy in an unnatural place. Red beside him, scrolling through his phone like he's waiting for a dentist appointment.

**Maryska** is brought in, chained and gagged. Still elegant, still carrying herself like royalty. When they remove her gag, her eyes lock onto Noc with predatory hunger.

**Toreador Elder (smooth as silk):** "Maryska is lucid today. We thought it might benefit our records if you offered a statement in her presence."

**Noc (politely confused):** "A statement about what?"

**Toreador Elder:** "Your... experiences. With her."

**Noc (blinking slowly):** "I'm sorry, experiences with who?"

Maryska goes rigid.

**Noc (squinting at her like trying to remember):** "Wait... do we know each other? You look familiar. Did we go to school together?"

**Maryska (voice tight):** "Don't you dareâ€”"

**Noc (snapping his fingers):** "Oh! Right, right... Maryska! I remember now." (pause) "Barely. You used to be... what was it... important? To someone?" (genuine confusion) "Was it me? That seems unlikely."

**Red (not looking up from his phone):** "Babe, Seras has soccer practice at four. And we need to pick up groceries."

**Noc (brightening immediately):** "Oh right! Can't miss that. She's been working on her penalty kicks." (to the Council) "Sorry, is this going to take much longer? I'm not really sure why you thought I'd have anything to say about..." (waves vaguely in Maryska's direction) "...whatever this is."

**Maryska (desperate, voice rising):** "I MADE you! I broke you down and rebuilt you into something magnificent!"

**Noc (pausing mid-sip of tea):** "Hm? Sorry, were you still talking?" (to Red) "Did you hear something? Like a... buzzing?"

**Red (still on his phone):** "Probably just old pipes. These places are ancient."

**Maryska (frantic):** "You SCREAMED my name! You BEGGED at my feet!"

**Noc (looking around the room):** "Is there a draft in here? I keep hearing this weird whining sound."

**Toreador Elder (fascinated despite himself):** "Mr. Rhaegis, surely you remember your... captivity?"

**Noc (thoughtful):** "Oh, that? Yeah, that was ages ago. Some crazy person with control issues. What was her name again?" (snaps fingers) "Marsha? Melissa? Something with an M..."

**Maryska (screaming):** "MARYSKA! MY NAME IS MARYSKA!"

**Noc (mild interest):** "Right, that's it. Thanks." (to Red) "Didn't she used to hang around with that other guy? The wolf? What happened to him again?"

**Red (finally looking up):** "Maldaldo? Oh, he's fertilizer somewhere in the Amazon by now."

**Noc (nodding):** "Right, right. Fertilizer." (back to Maryska) "You should probably join him. Seems like a good career move for... people like you."

**Maryska (voice breaking):** "You can't just... forget me! I'm IN your nightmares!"

**Noc (genuinely puzzled):** "Are you? I have really good dreams lately. Last night I dreamed about building a treehouse with the kids." (to Red) "Remember? You were there too, making sure the hammock was tied right."

**Red (soft smile):** "That was a good dream."

**Noc (standing up, checking his watch):** "Well, this has been... something. Thanks for clearing that up, Council. Though honestly, I'm still not sure why you thought I'd remember some random..." (squints at Maryska again) "...person."

**Maryska (one last desperate attempt):** "I'll escape! I'll find you! I'll make you remember!"

**Noc (already walking away, calling over his shoulder):** "Sure, sure. You do that." (to Red) "Think we should get pizza for dinner?"

**Red (following):** "The kids would love that."

**Noc (voice fading as they leave):** "Great. Oh, and maybe some of those breadsticks Karma likes..."

The door closes.

**Maryska sits in her chains, screaming at an empty room.**

**The Toreador Elder looks at her with something approaching pity:** "Well. That was... thorough."

Outside, Noc and Red walk hand in hand toward their car, discussing soccer schedules and grocery lists like they just finished the most mundane errand in the world.

Because to them, they had.

**The most devastating defeat isn't being conquered.**

**It's being forgotten.**
