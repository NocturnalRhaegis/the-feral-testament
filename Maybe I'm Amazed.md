The humid air clung to Nocturnal Rhaegis as he sat on the porch of his Louisiana Caern, the swampy scent of earth and water filling his senses. His eyes scanned the horizon, where the sun was beginning to sink below the line of cypress trees, casting long shadows over the land. It was quiet here, aside from the soft buzz of cicadas and the occasional croak of a bullfrog. The kind of quiet that usually set him on edge—too much silence left room for his thoughts to surface, thoughts he often tried to push aside.

But tonight was different.

*Baby, I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time*  
*And maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you*  
*Maybe I'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time*  
*You hung me on a line*  
*Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you*

The soft strumming of Paul McCartney’s “Maybe I’m Amazed” played gently from inside the house, drifting through the screen door and wrapping around him like a comforting breeze. Noc closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair, feeling the pull of the music. It was a song he hadn’t paid much attention to in the past, but tonight the lyrics seemed to speak directly to him, pulling something from the depths of his mind.

*Maybe I'm a man*  
*Maybe I'm a lonely man who's in the middle of something*  
*That he doesn't really understand*  
*Maybe I'm a man*  
*And maybe you're the only one who could ever help me*  
*Baby, won't you help me to understand?*  

His thoughts turned, inevitably, to Red. The man who had come into his life like a force of nature, fierce and wild, but with a heart so steady that Noc had found himself drawn to him in ways he hadn’t expected. He had fought against it, as he always did. He was a survivor, a fighter—someone who refused to be vulnerable. And yet here he was, unable to deny the way Red had become woven into his soul, softening the hard edges he had spent so many years sharpening.

For the longest time, Noc had insisted on control. It wasn’t something he’d chosen lightly—it was born from necessity, from years of torment and manipulation. After what he’d endured under Maryska’s hand, he swore no one would ever hold power over him again. He had to be the one in control, the one calling the shots, or else the darkness would creep in and swallow him whole.

But now...now he found himself questioning that need. Sitting here, in the warmth of the fading sunlight, he felt something shift inside him.

*Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time*  
*And maybe I'm afraid of the way I leave you*  
*Maybe I'm amazed at the way you help me sing my song*  
*You right me when I'm wrong*  
*Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you*

Noc chuckled softly under his breath, feeling the truth of those words settle over him. He had been afraid—afraid of what it meant to give someone that much of himself. Afraid of what it meant to truly trust another person, to let down the walls he had built so carefully around his heart. Red had been patient with him, letting him take the lead, knowing Noc needed to feel in control.

But maybe that wasn’t what he needed anymore.

Noc’s fingers absentmindedly traced the wood of the porch railing, his thoughts unraveling with the music. He realized, with a slow, almost reluctant clarity, that control had always been his shield, not his strength. It had kept him safe, sure, but it had also kept him distant, closed off from the love that Red had offered so freely.

_Maybe I’m amazed at the way you pulled me out of time..._

He smiled to himself, feeling the tension he’d been carrying for so long start to melt away. Red had always been his equal, his balance, the one who understood him in ways no one else ever had. And maybe, just maybe, it was time to stop fighting that. To let Red take the lead for once. To surrender—not in weakness, but in trust. Trust that Red would never hurt him. Trust that Red would hold him with the same care and strength he had always shown.

His heart beat a little faster at the thought, a mix of fear and exhilaration running through him. It was strange, how the idea of giving up control—a concept that once filled him with dread—now felt like the most natural thing in the world. Because Red wasn’t a threat. He was safety. He was love.

_Maybe I’m a man...and maybe you’re the only one who could ever help me..._

The lyrics danced in the air around him, sinking into his skin. He wasn’t a man used to letting his guard down, but with Red...he could. He wanted to. This wasn’t about dominance, or power, or control. This was about something deeper, something more real than anything he had ever known.

It wasn’t an act of defeat to give up control. It was an act of perfect love and trust. And in that trust, Noc realized, there was freedom. Freedom to be himself without the need for masks or armor. Freedom to let Red be who he was, too.

Noc opened his eyes and let out a long, steady breath. He felt lighter, more at peace than he had in years. A smile tugged at the corner of his lips as he thought of Red, inside the house, probably moving about, getting ready for the evening.

_Maybe I’m amazed at the way I really need you..._

For the first time, the idea of needing someone didn’t fill him with anxiety. It felt right. As he stood and turned to go back inside, Noc smiled to himself again, knowing that from here on out, things would be different.

And he was ready for it.
