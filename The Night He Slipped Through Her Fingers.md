_(Maryshka’s POV – After Noc’s Escape)_

The halls of her Romanian fortress stood **silent**, but the moment Maryshka stepped into the cold corridor where **his** cell had been, she **felt it**—an absence, a void where her favorite plaything should have remained.

She paused, tracing the stone wall with the edge of her nail, as if she could still catch the heat of him lingering there.

Nocturnal Rhaegis. **Her obsession. Her pet.**

The boy she had **plucked from his promising life**, that scrawny, studious thing with eyes full of fire and **just enough defiance** to make the breaking _satisfying._

She had seen **potential** in him, more than he ever imagined. His mind fascinated her—so sharp, so disciplined, but it was that underlying **resistance**, that refusal to bend, that **captivated her most**.

How many nights had she pushed him to the edge? How many times had she **bruised that pale skin**, left him **gasping**, **crying**, thinking that maybe this time—this time—**he would finally break**?

But he never had.

Oh, he had screamed. He had wept. He had obeyed. But there was always **something missing**. A piece of him that refused to bend, a defiance woven **deep into his bones**.

It **infuriated her.** It **excited her.** It **made her want him even more.**

Maryshka clenched her fists, nails pressing into skin, drawing thin lines of blood.

She had given him **everything**, hadn’t she? A place by her side. Power, control, even the chance to **rise above what he had been**. All he had to do was submit. To be **hers.** Completely.

**And he had the gall to escape.**

Her cloak billowed behind her as she stormed through the corridor, boots striking the stone floor **like a war drum**.

How long had he been gone? **A few hours? Less?**

It didn’t matter. She would **find** him. She would **drag** him back. And this time, oh this time, she would **break** him.

She would find that piece of him that still clung to hope, that foolish **belief in freedom**, and she would **crush it beneath her heel**.

Maryshka’s lips curled into a **twisted smile**.

She had been **kind**, in her way. Hadn’t she?

She had **offered** him power. Even affection. If he had just **given in**, she would have treated him like a king.

But no. He had to keep fighting. He had to keep that streak of **rebellion burning inside him**.

She could almost hear his voice in her head, **low and steady**, that same voice that had once cried out **her** name in pain but had never truly _begged_.

Never truly _submitted_.

It enraged her. **It thrilled her.**

It made her **starve** for the day he would finally crumble.

She entered her chamber, where her lieutenants stood waiting, faces pale, wary, bracing for the storm.

Her voice was calm. **Terrifyingly calm.**

**"Find him."**

Her eyes gleamed with something dark, something **cold**, something **unchanged by time or distance**.

He belonged to her.

He was **hers to control, to manipulate, to break**.

And if she had to chase him to the ends of the earth, she would remind him of that.

She stood alone in her chamber, the shadows flickering across her face. A small, cruel smile played on her lips.

**“Run, little wolf.”**

Her voice was **barely a whisper**.

**“But you’ll never be free.”**

He could run. He could hide.

But she had left a **mark** on him—one that **would never fade**.

No matter how far he fled, he would **always** remember who had shaped him.

Who had **made** him.

Who had made him **hers**.
