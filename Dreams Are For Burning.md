[Verse 1]
I was three when the world got quiet,
Momma slipped into the veil, no goodbye.
Left with a name and a scent on a scrap—
Father stared past me like I was a map
of something he lost and didn’t want back.

The caern watched like wolves in the rain,
Too spooked to hold me, too holy to blame.
They called it “grief,” but I knew the game:
I looked like her, and that felt like shame.

[Chorus]
So light the match, let the temple fall,
I was born for fire, not for walls.
They made me a Ronin, said I went too far—
But I just followed a mother-shaped scar.
If dreams are the chains that keep you returning—
Then f*** your rules—
Dreams are for burning.

[Verse 2]
Fifteen and broken, but wide awake,
Her voice in the dark like a ripple on a lake.
Stepped through the veil—was it her or the Wyrm?
Didn’t know, didn’t care, I had to learn.
Didn’t get a trial, just the exile brand—
Said I trespassed with a child’s hands.

No mercy for girls who hear ghost-song,
No room in the tribe for the witchborn wrong.

[Chorus]
So light the match, let the temple fall,
I was born for fire, not for walls.
They made me a Ronin, said I went too far—
But I just followed a mother-shaped scar.
If dreams are the chains that keep you returning—
Then f*** your rules—
Dreams are for burning.

[Bridge]
I carry her scent, I carry her sin,
They cast me out for the spark within.
But let them run, and let them kneel—
I'll be the storm their lies can't heal.

[Final Chorus]
Light the match, let the silence scream,
I was never your child, I am not your dream.
I walk alone with a blade and a flame,
They gave me exile—I made it a name.
So if dreams are the trap that leaves you yearning—
Let it all burn—
Dreams are for burning.
