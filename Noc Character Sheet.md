Notes:
Nocturnal Miguel Rhaegis

_Early Life_

Nocturnal Miguel Rhaegis, known as Noc to those who came to know him, was born on a chilly Halloween morning in Los Alamos, New Mexico. The world first met him at 3:21 am on October 31, 1982, under the watchful eyes of his parents, Roberto and Carlita Rhaegis. From a young age, it was evident that Noc was not an ordinary child. His insatiable curiosity and relentless drive set him apart from his peers. By the time he was sixteen, Noc had graduated from high school, a testament to his overachieving nature and remarkable intellect. However, the relationship between Noc and his parents was always strained. His relentless pursuit of knowledge and success created a distance between him and his family, who struggled to understand his ambitions.

_Academic Excellence_
Noc's journey continued as he pursued higher education. By September 12, 2012, he had earned a Bachelor of Science degree in microbiology. His passion for science and discovery pushed him to immediately embark on a Master’s program. It seemed that Noc was destined for a life of academic accolades and scientific breakthroughs.

_The South American Nightmare_
In March 2014, Noc left for South America, eager to conduct research for his thesis. What was supposed to be a two-month trip turned into a nightmare. On March 30, 2014, he was brutally attacked and captured by Maryska Dragomir, a name that would forever haunt his dreams. During the attack, Noc was turned into a werewolf, a transformation that added a new layer of torment to his already dire situation. For nearly a year and a half, from April 1, 2014, to September 18, 2015, Noc endured unimaginable horrors. Held captive in Romania, he was forced into pit fighting, subjected to physical abuse, and made to serve against his will. The constant cycle of violence and degradation tested the limits of his spirit.

_The Great Escape_
Despite the torment, Noc's indomitable will to survive never waned. On September 19, 2015, he managed to escape, saving several other slaves in the process. His return to New Mexico on October 2, 2015, was bittersweet. When he revealed his affliction to his parents, their reaction was one of fear and rejection. Disowned and heartbroken, Noc found himself alone and struggling to survive.

_The Underground Fighter_
Starvation drove Noc to his first underground fight on November 14, 2015. It was in this brutal world that he met Red Knight, a figure who would become a pivotal part of his life. Over the next few years, Noc earned a fearsome reputation as a brutal fighter. By February 15, 2017, his renown had grown to the point where he began adopting ronin and unclaimed shifters, offering them the guidance and protection he had once needed.

_The Campaigns_
Noc’s life was marked by a series of campaigns, each more challenging than the last. On March 12, 2017, during the first campaign, he witnessed a shaman being killed in front of him. Though the shaman was a stranger, the event triggered a profound change in Noc. The senseless murder pushed him to set aside his life of fighting and embrace the path of a Cahalith—a werewolf shaman. This decision marked a significant turning point in his life.

The second campaign, beginning on June 1, 2017, saw him confront a terrifying creature known as the face hugger. Then, on July 2, 2017, during the third campaign, Noc faced Maryska once more. This time, he emerged victorious, putting an end to the nightmare that had begun years earlier.

_The Undocumented Years_
The years that followed were undocumented, known as Sobek’s Campaigns. Noc’s actions during this time remain shrouded in mystery, but they were undoubtedly filled with the same intensity and determination that had characterized his earlier years.

_The Stranger Things Era_
In early 2024, Noc found himself embroiled in a series of events tied to the Stranger Things universe. From March 1 to June 22, 2024, he faced unimaginable challenges. In a final act of self-sacrifice, Noc died, only to be resurrected. This period was marked by profound loss, including the death of his entire pack of ronin.  In a symbolic gesture indicative of his Native heritage, when loss struck and the younglings he was caring for were killed, he cut his hair, only for Rissa to give it back, signifying a rebirth of sorts. However, there were also moments of joy and love. Noc married Red on Aug 15, 2024, and despite the heartache, found a semblance of peace.

Updated Gifts:
_Smell of Man_
Rank 1 Homid Gift
Creatures of the wild have learned well that where man goes, death follows. With this Gift the werewolf enhances the human scent around him greatly, causing wild animals to feel uneasy and nervous. However, the scent also causes domestic animals to recognize the werewolf as their master. An ancestor-spirit teaches this Gift.

**System**:
All wild animals (not including supernatural creatures in animal form) lose one die from their dice pools when within 20 feet of the Garou (save when defending themselves or running away), and they are likely to flee. All domesticated animals recognize the werewolf as a friend and refuse to harm him. For example, an attack-trained dog ordered to take down the werewolf would run up to the character and wag its tail. If the domesticated animal is harmed, then it will revert to acting naturally. The Garou may use this Gift at will. He simply states when she is activating it or turning it off.

_Sense Weaver_
Rank 1 Theurge Gift
The Garou may sense Weaver energies or spirits in the nearby area. This Gift is taught by any Gaian spirit.

**System**:
The Garou rolls Perception + Science against a difficulty determined by the Storyteller, based on the strength of the presence. Source: Umbra

_Network Terminal_
Rank 1 Glass Walker Gift
Camp: Random Interrupts
Computers have grown more and more connected in recent years, most prominently via the Internet. Meanwhile, no matter how good your computer is, there’s probably someone with a better computer and you’re likely connected to it. This Gift connects the Random Interrupt to the theoretical better computer, making all work much easier. A Pattern Spider teaches this Gift.

**System**:
The player rolls Gnosis, difficulty 7. Every success adds one die to any roll involving the Computer Knowledge. The Gift doesn’t provide you with a computer; you actually need to be seated at a computer that has some form of network connection.
Source: Glass Walker Tribebook (revised)

_Control Simple Machine_
Rank 1 Glass Walker Gift
The Garou may command the spirits of the simplest machines, causing levers to flip, doors to unbolt, pulleys to roll and so on. Any technological spirit can teach this Gift.

**System**:
The player spends a Willpower point and rolls Manipulation + Crafts (difficulty 7). The Garou’s control lasts until the end of the scene.
Source: Core book revised.

_Persuasion_
This Gift allows a Garou to become more persuasive when dealing with others, in such a way that his statements and arguments are imbued with added meaning or credibility. An ancestor-spirit teaches this Gift.

**System**[](https://darkforcesmush.fandom.com/wiki/Gift:_Persuasion?veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: System")**:**
The player rolls Charisma + Subterfuge. If successful, the Storyteller reduces the difficulties of all Social rolls by one for the remainder of the scene. In addition, any successful Social rolls may have significantly more impact than they would without the Gift. A werewolf could win arguments with hard line opponents, or cause a cold-hearted psychopath to relent (at least for a little while).

_Falling Touch_
This Gift allows the Garou to send her foe sprawling with but a touch. Any aerial spirit can teach this Gift.

**System**[](https://darkforcesmush.fandom.com/wiki/Gift:_Falling_Touch?veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: System")**:**
The Garou's player rolls Dexterity + Medicine (difficulty of the opponent's Stamina + Athletics). Even one success sends the victim to the ground. Doing so counts as an action; activating this Gift and striking a foe with intent to harm are two separate things.
Source: 3rd ed WWtA Corebook

_Cybersenses_
Rank 2 Glasswalker Gift[](https://darkforcesmush.fandom.com/wiki/Gift:_Cybersenses?veaction=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Cybersenses (Rank 2)")
By studying both his natural senses and the sensory capabilities of machines, the Garou may exchange the former for the latter. He may choose to exchange normal hearing for radar, or ordinary sight for infrared or UV sight. Any technological spirit can teach this Gift.

**System**[](https://darkforcesmush.fandom.com/wiki/Gift:_Cybersenses?veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: System")**:**
The player spends one Gnosis point per sense affected, and he rolls Perception + Science thereafter to activate the Garou's new senses. This Gift lasts for one scene.
Source: 3rd ed WWtA Corebook

RANK 2
_Jam Technology_
Rank 2 Homid Gift / Rank 2 Glass Walker Gift
The werewolf can cause technological devices to cease functioning, albeit temporarily. Even the simplest of shaped objects will refuse to perform its function. A Gremlin — a type of Wyld-spirit that enjoys breaking things — teaches this Gift

**System**:
The player spends one Gnosis point and rolls Manipulation + Crafts. The werewolf may choose the level of complexity she intends to “jam.” All technological devices (i.e., any devices shaped from fabricated materials like metal or plastic) of that complexity within 50 feet cease functioning for one turn per success. The devices remain unchanged but inert. Knives won’t cut, gunpowder won’t ignite, gears won’t turn and so on. The difficulty of the roll is based on the following chart:

|Computer|4|
|Phone|6|
|Automobile|8|

_Mind Partition_
Rank 2 Glass Walker Gift
Camp: Random Interrupts
A favorite among Random Interrupts who discover they can’t multitask nearly as well as their computers, this Gift allows the Garou to break their own mind into segments, quickly switching their concentration to a new task while never losing their place on the old task. One Cruncher described the Gift by saying, “It’s not true multitasking, but it fakes it well.” A Pattern Spider teaches this Gift.

**System**:
The player spends one Willpower point and rolls Gnosis (difficulty 6). For every success gained, the player can add work on one extra extended action every turn, one added per turn. No penalties are incurred on any of the extended actions, but if just one botch is rolled, all uncompleted tasks fail.
Source: Glass Walker Tribebook (revised)

RANK 3
_Cowing the Bullet_
Rank 3 Homid Gift
The spirits of tools recognize man as their master; as a result, they become reluctant to harm the homid. A Weaver-spirit teaches this Gift.

**System**: 
The player spends a Gnosis point. For the rest of the scene, the Garou gains two additional soak dice against all crafted weapons not made of silver.
Source: 20th Anniversary Edition

_Exorcism_
Rank 3 Theurge Gift
This is the Gift of ejecting spirits from places or objects, whether they are there voluntarily or are bound there. Any Incarna avatar can teach this Gift.

**System**:
The Garou must concentrate uninterrupted for three turns. If a spirit does not wish to leave, the player must make a Manipulation + Intimidation roll (difficulty of the spirit’s Willpower). If the spirit has been bound to its lodging place (or into a fetish), then the exorcist must make a Wits + Subterfuge roll (difficulty 8) and gain more successes than the binder did when tying the spirit to its location. This Gift can be used to “cure” fomori, although the host will surely die as the Bane is ejected unless a powerful healer manages to preserve her live during the exorcism.
Source: Core book revised.

_Evocation of the Ceremony_
Rank 3 Theurge Gift
Rituals are not used only to evoke supernatural effects; they also have an inherent value to Theurges in and of themselves. Using this Gift, the Garou evokes a sense of awe, reverence and holy mystery through ritualistic behavior — anything from a Garou rite to a Catholic sacrament. Along with any normal mystical effect, the ceremony produces a sense of reaffirmation and cosmological belonging in everybody who participates. While Theurges usually use this effect to strengthen sincere spiritual devotions or build community among Garou, it’s just as easily abused to keep participants in a rite in ignorant, dogmatic fear of the supernatural world — the Theurge’s intent, not the nature of the Gift, determines which is the case. An enigmatic spirit teaches this Gift.

**System**:
Any being can attempt to inspire, unify or cow an audience through ritualism with a Cha + Rit, Occ, Perf or Subt roll as appropriate to the exact situation. Possession of this Gift increases the Charisma of the Theurge by four dots, only for the purposes of such attempts (to a maximum of nine).
Source: Book of Auspices

_Data Flow_
Rank 3 Glass Walker Gift
The Glass Walkers originally developed this Gift as a “remote control” for new electronic devices. As the computer gained importance, this Gift gained a whole new utility. Glass Walkers now use this ability to take control of the data resources that are so important to the world’s economy and to society in general. By focusing her attention on a single computer, a Glass Walker can take control of that machine from across the room. She can order it to erase its memory, alter security clearances, transmit false data or simply print a document. An electrical spirit or the even more complex computer spirits can teach this Gift.

**System**:
A successful Wits + Computer roll (difficulty 7) plus the expenditure of one Gnosis point establishes contact with the computer. As long as the Garou keeps her target in her line of sight, she can maintain contact with the machine. While this Gift allows remote access, the Garou must still make all the appropriate roll to manipulate the computer.
Source: Player’s Guide Second Edition.

_Control Complex Machine_
Rank 3 Glass Walker Gift
Similar to [Control Simple Machine](http://www.wyrmfoe.com/382/control-simple-machine/), the Garou may now converse with and command the spirits of electronic devices such as computers, video games, and cars. One learns (or steals) this Gift from a Net-Spider.

**System**:
The player spends one Willpower point and rolls Manipulation + Science (or Computer). The Storyteller sets the difficulty based on how complex the machine actually is (usually 8). The Garou’s control lasts for one scene.
Source: Core book revised.

RANK 4
_Body Shift_
Rank 4 Homid Gift / Rank 4 Ahroun Gift / Rank 4 Get of Fenris Gift
Garou raised in the shifting maze of human society are well-prepared for the endless adaptations Gaia demands of her protectors. An ancestor-spirit teaches this Gift.

**System**: 
The Garou can use her shapeshifting to alter her physical Attributes: a dot of Dexterity can be shifted to Strength or Stamina, and so forth. The player rolls Stamina + Primal-Urge (difficulty 9). For each two successes, one physical Attribute dot can be shifted for the rest of the scene.
Source: 20th Anniversary

_Blurring the Mirror_
Rank 4 Theurge Gift
This Gift allows the Theurge to cloud the minds of other beings, making it impossible for them to find the Umbra or step sideways into it. Once used as a form of punishment for arrogant pups, this Gift is more often deployed as a weapon against Black Spiral Dancers in the days of the coming Apocalypse. A Weaver-spirit teaches this Gift.

**System**: 
The player spends one Gnosis point for every individual she wishes to affect. The Gauntlet increases by five for those targets for the rest of the scene. Up to five individuals can be affected at once. While normally used against other Garou, this Gift is effective against any being capable of entering the Umbra sideways, including other Fera and some mages.
Source: 20th Anniversary Edition

RANK 5
_Beyond Human_
Rank 5 Homid Gift  
The Garou is human plus. Human plus strength, agility and health. Human plus devoted, assured spirituality and meaning. Human plus animal instinct and lightning reflexes. He is as man, but greater and more whole. Every Garou radiates this to some extent, causing humans to fear and avoid them instinctively. This Gift warps this perception, turning the Garou from a figure to be avoided into a figure to be admired or adored. An ancestor-spirit teaches this Gift.

**System**:
Once learned, this Gift is always active. Humans dealing with the character will immediately pick her out as more desirable, attractive, smarter or more charismatic compared to throw around them, regardless of their actual capacity in such matters. The Curse still applies, but rather than being instinctively feared as a predator, the werewolf is dreaded as an intimidating figure of great presence. Also, the character may boost his Social Attributes by spending Rage or Gnosis, each dot of either spent raises one Social Attribute by one point for a single scene.
Source: Players’ Guide to Garou (revised)

_Healing the Soul_
Rank 5 Theurge Gift
Through a week-long ordeal of fasting, trance states and spirit communication, the Theurge is able to set the elements of the Triat into perfect balance within one individual’s soul. Obviously, the subject to be healed must be willing, and the two individuals must remain in solitude (save for contact with spirits) for the duration. This Gift can cure insanity, ease emotional wounds, heal the effects of trauma and remove desensitization. If the spiritual injury was caused by ill conduct on the subject’s part, however, this Gift can only benefit them once: even the greatest empath has little sympathy for those who willingly slide back into self-degradation after being helped out the first time. An avatar of Unicorn teaches this Gift.

**System**:
The effects are largely character and story-based. This Gift alone cannot cure full-blown Harano, but it can certainly ameliorate the causes, preventing it before it takes hold completely.

If the Storyteller has already embraced the complications of mechanical crossover in her Werewolf chronicle, she may elect to allow this Gift to restore one or two levels of Humanity, or subtract one or two levels of permanent Angst, once in a given vampire or wraith’s life. Of course, very few Garou elders would ever consider wasting Gaia’s blessings on a Leech, even a penitent one.
Source: Book of Auspices

_Summon Net-Spider_
Rank 5 Glass Walker Gift
The Garou can summon a Net-Spider, a Weaver spirit that gives its summoner near-absolute control over any computer system. The Spider can disrupt, erase or destroy whatever system it is sent into (the exact effects are left to the Storyteller, but are typically destructive). An avatar of Cockroach teaches this Gift.

**System**:
The player spends one Gnosis point and rolls Charisma + Computer (difficulty 8). If successful, the Net-Spider appears and heeds the Garou’s commands. This Gift allows the Garou to halve all computer-related difficulties along with the aforementioned destructive capacity of the spirit.
Source: Core book revised.

**Custom Gifts**
Tempus Fugit
Garou may alter and manipulate the time stream in a localized area, depending on the number of successful rolls.

**System**:
Spend 10 gnosis (expanded rules) per dot of desired effect, roll Man+Sta, difficulty 7.
This gift requires at least 2 successes to activate. Each additional success equals an increase in time manipulated/area of effect. Garou is invisible/invulnerable while under the out-of-the-time-stream effect, but will suffer physical damage when they re-enter their proper time. (Amount of damage is up to Storyteller discretion)

RITES
_Rite of Cleansing_
This rite purifies a person, place or object, allowing it to be used without fear of Wyrm-taint. The most common form of this rite involves the ritemaster inscribing a circle on the earth, walking counterclockwise around the afflicted person(s) or object(s) while holding a smoldering branch or torch. She must use a branch (preferably willow or birch) dipped in pure water or snow to sprinkle the object or person cleansed. As the ritemaster does so, all Garou present release an eerie, otherworldly howl in an attempt to frighten away the corrupting influence. Ideally, this rite is performed at dawn, but may function at any time. 

**System**:[](https://darkforcesmush.fandom.com/wiki/Rite:_Cleansing?veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: System")
This rite can be cast upon more than one person or object, but the ritemaster must spend one Gnosis point on each extra thing in need of cleansing. Only one success is required. The difficulty level depends on the level of taint. For instance, taint caused by a spirit might carry a difficulty of the spirit’s Gnosis. If the rite is performed at dawn, the difficulty decreases by one. This rite cannot heal wounds or damage caused by Wyrm-taint — it only removes the spiritual contamination itself. This rite cannot cleanse taint of the most innate sort, either, instead inflicting agony when performed upon a fomori, vampire, unrepentant Black Spiral Dancer or other similarly corrupt being.

_Baptism of Fire_
Most tribes attempt to track down all children born to their Kinfolk within one month of the children's birth to see if they "share the blood". Those who are Garou are "baptized" in the light of their auspice moon, beside a rite fire. Such a baptism most commonly involves mingling ashes with a few drops of Garou blood; the mixture is then touched to the child's ears, nose, eyelids, and tongue.

In the presence of one the lesser tribal spirits, known as a Kin-Fetch, the babe is then held up to the moonlight while the baptizing Garou howls Gaia's greeting to the newborn. The ritemaster then has the Kin-Fetch kiss the infant. The spirit's fiery kiss inscribes a spiritual brand upon the babe in the form of the newborn's tribal pictograph. This mark is not visible on the newborn's body; the only mark left is spiritual. It is impossible to remove this spiritual brand. Such a mark can be traced and recognized by all Garou (including Black Spiral Dancers, who all too often track down cubs of other tribes and capture them in order to create more of the foul number).

The participating Kin-Fetch spirit is assigned to watch over the young Garou as she grows to maturity, so that the tribe may always know the child's location and whether she is endangered. When the child is about to undergo the First Change and is ready for the Rite of Passage, the spirit alerts the tribe. Unfortunately, such minor spirits are notoriously weak-willed and easily distracted. All too often a Kin-Fetch loses track of its charge or becomes lost itself, leaving the young cub on her own. Such "lost cubs," unless they are miraculously picked up by a tribe upon their First Change, often become Lunatics or recluses, terrified of themselves and unable to understand their powerful primal urges.

**System**:[](https://darkforcesmush.fandom.com/wiki/Rite:_Baptism_of_Fire?veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: System")
The ritemaster makes a Charisma + Rituals roll (difficulty 6). Only one success is required, but additional successes improve the chance that the Kin-Fetch will keep track of the child. This rite must be performed at night under the moon in which the child was born. Although this rite is normally performed within a month of birth, the brand can be inscribed at any time before the cub reaches adolescence and undergoes her First Change.
Source: Werewolf the Apocalypse

_Rite of Talisman Dedication_
This rite allows a Garou to bind objects to her body, allowing these objects to fit the Garou's various forms (jeans will grow to accommodate the size increase of the Crinos form, etc.) and accompany the Garou into the Umbra. Such talismans are most commonly mundane items, for spiritual items such as fetishes and talens automatically remain with the Garou in all forms. A Garou most often performs this rite during the phase of the moon under which he was born. Each auspice has its own peculiar ritual.

**System**[](https://darkforcesmush.fandom.com/wiki/Rite:_Talisman_Dedication?veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: System")**:**
The cost is one Gnosis point per object dedicated, and a Garou may never have more objects bound to himself than his Gnosis score. Certain particularly large objects (Storyteller's discretion) are considered more than one of the purpose of "cost". For the purposes of Dedication, an entire set of clothing is considered one item.

The Storyteller and the player should decide what happens to the object when the character assumes certain forms. For example, when the character assumes Crinos form, her backpack's straps may simply grow to fit around her shoulders (although the pack still cannot hold more items than normal). When the character is in Hispo form, her knife may meld with her body. In such cases, the object will appear as a tattoo; others must spend a Willpower point to remove the object from the character.

Note on Dedicated Items: A full set of clothing (top, bottom, undergarments, shoes, socks, coats, and so on) counts as one item. The idea here is that if you don't intend to use it in another form (glabro being the exception, since it can use most human items normally), the item counts as part of a character's 'full set'.

Additional accessories count as additional items. A weapon is one item (including a loaded gun). An additional clip of bullets is one item. A holstered weapon can be dedicated as part of the note full set of clothing, but if this is the case, it can not be recovered when a character shifts, and is only available in non-wolf forms. Items in pockets are likewise unavailable in any other form, but do not take extra dots of Gnosis.
Source: Werewolf the Apocalypse

_Moot Rite_
This rite is required to open any sort of moot. At such moots, the caerns of the Garou are recharged with Gnosis. The rite always includes a prolonged howl led by a Garou known as the Master of the Howl. The howl varies by tribe and sept, but always expresses the unique nature of the sept. All Garou involved must form a circle within the caern itself before they commence howling.

**System**:
The rite must be performed at least once per month to keep a caern consecrated. During the course of a moot, the participants must empower the caern with five Gnosis points per caern level in order to replenish it fully.
Source: Werewolf the Apocalypse

_Last Blessing_
The mere existence of metis threatens the Veil, as they are born and die in Crinos form. This blessing is given to a dying or just-deceased metis by the ritemaster. It ensures that the corpse will assume the natural form which the metis most preferred — human or wolf — arousing no suspicion. Many metis have received this rite with joy, seeing it as a sign of Gaia’s forgiveness.

**System**:
Standard roll. The ritemaster lays hands on the metis and chants the Song of the True Form, then spends one Gnosis point. The metis’s body changes to Homid or Lupus form, and the change is permanent. This rite must be performed within an hour of death, and has no effect on a live metis.

_Right of Becoming_
Werewolves must perform this rite at an Anchorhead Domain. Once completed, it enables them to travel into the Deep Umbra. The most common version of this rite requires the Garou to make a braid from three of her hairs, three pieces of fine copper wire, and three tendrils of ivy or other vine. Lengths of silk thread are sometimes substituted for the hair or wire. When the braid has been constructed, the Garou ties it around his own wrist and howls three words of power.

**System**:
If the braid is destroyed while the Garou is in the Deep Umbra, the werewolf takes one level of aggravated damage and risks becoming lost forever if she doesn’t return quickly to the Near Umbra.

_Rite of the Loyal Pack_
A leader needs respect from those that follow him if he (and they) wish to succeed. Usually, only packs that have been working together for some time and who trust each other enough to further cement those bonds perform this rite.

The rite makes the whole pack's focus and commitment dependent on the pack alpha. In effect, they submit completely to him, in the hope of gaining an advantage from his commitment to working for the benefit of all. Each member of the pack must take a small item of personal significance and a length of his or her own hair and give it to the ritemaster. She then binds together all the objects using the hairs and buries the bundle within the pack's home caern.

**System**: 
The ritemaster’s player rolls Charisma + Rituals (difficulty 9 minus the pack alpha's Leadership). If the roll succeeds, the entire pack gains two extra points of Willpower at the beginning of each session as long as the pack alpha is acting in the best interests of the whole pack. (Note that this cannot put a character over their maximum Willpower.) However, if the alpha has not been acting in the pack’s interests, the entire pack loses two points of Willpower at the beginning of each session. The gain or loss is entirely at the Storyteller's discretion. Should the pack alpha change, the rite's effects immediately end.

_Rite of the Totem_
This rite binds a totem to a group of Garou. It is most often performed during the formation of a pack. During this rite, all Garou who wish to bind their destinies to a particular totem spirit must coat their eyes with an infusion of saliva and mugwort (or another substance holy to Gaia) and step sideways into the Umbra. In the spirit Realms, the ritemaster leads the Garou in a hunt for the spiritual spoor left by a totem spirit. Such evidence varies with the spirit, but is always found by Garou worthy of the totem's attention. Even tracking down the spirit does not guarantee success, for the totem must decide whether the Garou are worthy to become its fosterlings. An undecided totem may require a quest of the supplicants, though this is almost never required if the pack has just successfully completed a Rite of Passage.

Characters must purchase the Totem Background to benefit from this rite. Otherwise, the rite is simply not performed. However, as each pack member gets 1 Totem point per rank they hold, it is possible to undergo the Rite of the Totem without purchasing the Totem Background.

_Rite of the Opened Sky_
By sacrificing something of personal value and dancing a complex rain dance, the ritemaster can beckon great, purifying showers of rain to fall from the skies. This rain cleanses all Wyrm impurities, and can even heal wounds. 

**System**:[](https://darkforcesmush.fandom.com/wiki/Rite:_Opened_Sky?veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: System")
This rite works in much the same way as the Rite of Cleansing, but can encompass an entire caern and those within it. The ritemaster expends only one point of Gnosis to cleanse an area, but for every two additional points he spends, every character within the caern heals one level of damage — even aggravated damage. The difficulty of this rite depends on the level of taint, such as a tainted spirit’s Gnosis rating. Like the Rite of Cleansing, the difficulty of this rite can also be lowered by one if performed at dawn. Beings of the Wyrm and vampires suffer excruciating pain if exposed to this rite, though they are not cleansed or genuinely damaged. To use this rite outside a caern, the ritemaster must spend ten points of Gnosis — a feat only the most potent ritemasters of the Garou are capable of.

_Rite of Caern Building_
This powerful rite creates a caern, a permanent area where the spirit world and the physical world touch. Simply reciting the rite draws the attention of the Wyrm's servitors, and actually performing the rite has been known to prove fatal. Only the most powerful and wise mystics dare lead such an undertaking.

A power Theurge is almost always selected to perform this most sacred of rites. Many Garou must channel their energy through a powerful leader to have even a hope of success. Whole packs have been known to die in agony should the attempt fail.

Once the physical focus for the heart of the caern is chosen, the area must be cleansed of all taint in preparation for its transformation. All Garou participating in the rite must undergo a Rite of Cleansing.

The ritemaster performs a series of minor rituals, meditation, and other physical preliminaries to prepare for her awesome tasks.

Sentries must by posted (very often the players' characters), for servants of the Wyrm almost invariably attempt to disrupt such a great rite. Only the mightiest warriors are chosen for such an assignment, and their protection is critical to the success of the rite. The leader of the rite is helpless while he chants a long litany of verses designed to draw a great spirit into the prepared caern. Although it is possible to create a specific type of caern, most leaders leave this to Gaia and accept whatever caern she grants the sept.

Because an enormous amount of Gnosis is needed to create a new caern, a minimum of 13 Garou, one for each moon of the year, must participate in this rite. Regardless of the number of Garou aiding her, the ritemaster can only channel such a power stream of Gnosis through her system once per hour. The rite must performed at night. This means that in most places and at most times of the year, the ritemaster has only eight rolls (one per hour) to accomplish her task. This makes success fairly unlikely.

If, indeed, the rite does fail, all involved suffer five wounds. These are not aggravated, but are very painful and always leave small teardrop-shaped scars scattered across the Garou's body. Such scars are considered marks of bravery , and these "Tears of Gaia" are often highlighted by tattoos or paint and worn with pride by the Garou. The Garou say the scars are the result of Gaia crying out for her children's pain.

Time: The rite must be performed between the hours of sunset and sunrise during the waxing of the moon. Only the Black Spiral Dancers create caerns during the moon's waning.

**System**[](https://darkforcesmush.fandom.com/wiki/Rite:_Caern_Building?veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: System")
The rite requires an extended roll of Wits + Rituals, though the leader may only use as many dice as she Gnosis. The difficulty is always 8, and 40 successes are needed. Only one roll can be attempted per hour of the ritual.

Once the leader scores the required number of successes, all those involved in the rite must contribute Gnosis points - 100 are needed. If the total Gnosis available is not 100, all those participating in the rite begin to suffer aggravated wounds. Each wound counts as three more Gnosis points toward the total.

Botches during this rite are particularly deadly. All characters involved suffer seven Health Levels of damage, which means that even a Garou previously at full health becomes Incapacitated. Those Garou reduced to below Incapacitated must roll on the Battle Scars table, adding one die to the roll.

If the minimum number of success is rolled (40), the caern is ranked Level One. The Gauntlet of such an area is 4, and the spirits bound into the caern will grant powers approximately equal to Level One Gifts. Every five additional successes raises the level of the caern by one, correspondingly raising the magnitude of the powers the caern grants. At Level Three the Gauntlet of the area is 3, while at Level Five it is but 2. Immediately upon the rite's successful completion, the ritemaster must sacrifice a number of permanent Gnosis points equal to the level of the caern.

If a player's character should somehow assume the role of ritemaster and succeed, she receives three points of Glory, five points of Honor and seven points of Wisdom. Anyone else participating in the rite receives five points of Glory and three points of Honor. This is a legendary task and should be suitably rewarded.

**Merits and Flaws** 
(these differ from the sheet, storyteller may insist an any they choose, but if they have no preference, I’ll be using the notes)

_Animal Magnetism__: 1 point Merit_
You are especially attractive to others. You receive a - 2 to your difficulty on Seduction or Subterfuge rolls.

_Metamorph:_ _6 Point Merit_
You find it extremely easy to change forms and can do it even in your sleep. You do not need to roll to shift forms (you are considered to have an automatic five successes); nor do you need to spend a Rage point to instantly assume a desired form. In addition, if you are ever knocked unconscious (due to wounds, etc.), you can make a roll of Wits + Primal-Urge, difficulty 8, to assume whatever form you wish instead of reverting to your breed form.

_Mixed Morph:_ _1 Point Merit_
It is easy for you to transform certain body parts only, such as a hand to a claw while you remain in Homid form or changing your Lupus vocal cords into a human voice box. Your difficulty for such changes is only a 6.

_Immune to Wyrm Emanations:_ _6 Point Merit_
You have a special boon from Gaia: You are immune to the toxins of the Wyrm. You receive no penalty from supernatural radiation, balefire, Wyrm elementals and the like (although you still suffer damage from such attacks). Likewise, you are immune to Bane possession. Your sept recognizes this invulnerability and thrusts you into many dangerous perils with the expectation that you will use your immunity for the good of others.

_Daredevil:_ _3 point Merit_
You are good at taking risks, and are even better at surviving them. All difficulties are - 1 whenever you try something particularly dangerous, and you can ignore one botch result when you roll "ones" on such actions (you can cancel a single "one" that is rolled, as if you have an extra success).

_Nemesis: 5 point flaw_
You have an enemy, or perhaps a group of enemies. Someone wants to harm you. The value of the Flaw determines how powerful these enemies are. The most powerful enemies (kings or elder vampires) would be five-point Flaws, while someone nearer to your own power would be worth only one point. You must decide who your enemy is and how you earned such enmity in the first place.

_Nightmares:_ _1 point Flaw_
You experience horrendous nightmares every time you sleep, and memories of them haunt you during your waking hours. Sometimes the nightmares are so bad they cause you to lose one die on all your actions for the next night (Storyteller's discretion). Some of the nightmares may be so intense that you mistake them for reality. A crafty Storyteller will be quick to take advantage of this.

_Lifesaver:_ _3 point Flaw_
You believe that human life is a sacred gift, and will not take a person's life except in the most extreme of circumstances. You may not ever willingly endanger the lives of innocents or in any way participate in a killing. You have no problems with killing animals (for the right reasons), and will kill evil and inhuman creatures to protect others if necessary. (Be very careful, however, with your definition of "evil"....) Senseless death in all forms repulses you, and you feel that those who commit murder should be punished.

_Hunted_: 3 point Flaw_
You are pursued by a fanatical werewolf hunter who believes you are a dangerous, slavering beast inimical to humanity (whether you are or not). All your companions may be hunted by the same individual as well. Although this hunter seeks the destruction of all Garou, there is something about you that impassions this killer. The hunter is, for some reason, immune to the Delirium.

_Urban Bound: 2 point Flaw (reverse of Nature Bound)_
Legends are full of incidents concerning the connection to nature and strength; this Flaw represents the negative side of that link. Characters with this Flaw take their strength from contact with urban environments, and weaken when removed from it. In game terms, characters are at no penalty when in urban surroundings, yet subtract one die from all actions when in natural settings. For purposes of this Flaw, cities, wastelands and the like are considered urban.

_Notoriety__: 3 point Flaw_
You have a bad reputation among your peers; perhaps you violated the protocols once too often, or belong to an unpopular freehold, pack, etc. There is a two dice penalty to all dice rolls for social dealings with associated peers (specifically Elder Garou).
