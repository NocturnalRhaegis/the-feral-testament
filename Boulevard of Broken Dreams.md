The streets of Albuquerque whispered secrets in the moonlight, shadows slithering around him like ghosts. Noc moved through the dimly lit alleys, feeling the cool night air prick his skin, a constant reminder of the world’s indifference to his suffering. Each step felt heavier than the last, burdened by memories that clawed at his sanity, remnants of a past that refused to let go.

*I walk a lonely road*  
*The only one that I have ever known*  
*Don't know where it goes*  
*But it's home to me, and I walk alone*

Libra slept a few blocks away in the creased comfort of a tattered blanket, nestled against the unforgiving concrete. She had become his anchor, her soft breaths a balm for his restless soul. But as night deepened, the solace she provided faded, replaced by a suffocating loneliness that coiled around his heart. He couldn’t shake the feeling of being utterly alone, even in the presence of his friend.

His mind drifted back to their life on the run—scrambling from one shelter to the next, evading the scrutiny of the world outside. In moments of desperation, they would share whispered hopes of a future, but with each passing day, that hope felt more like a cruel joke. The specter of Maryshka haunted him still, her laughter echoing in the corners of his mind. Noc could almost see her, lurking just out of sight, a puppeteer pulling the strings of his torment.

*I walk this empty street*  
*On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams*  
*Where the city sleeps*  
*And I'm the only one, and I walk alone*

As he wandered the streets, the thrill of underground fighting lured him like a moth to a flame. He found himself drawn to the dark places—abandoned warehouses, basements filled with the scent of sweat and blood. It was a chaotic symphony of violence, the perfect escape from the prison of his thoughts. Here, he could shed the weight of his guilt and pain, if only temporarily. Each punch he threw felt like a release, a chance to drown out the memories of his torment.

*My shadow's the only one that walks beside me*  
*My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating*  
*Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me*  
*'Til then, I walk alone*

But the reprieve was fleeting. Even as he fought, the familiar claws of isolation dug deeper. The fighters he faced were mere shadows, faceless opponents in a brutal dance, their expressions cold and indifferent. In those moments of violence, he fought not just for survival but for a semblance of sanity. Yet, each victory felt hollow, a bitter reminder that no matter how many battles he won, the war within raged on.

*Read between the lines*  
*What's fucked up, and everything's alright*  
*Check my vital signs*  
*To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone*

He pressed on through the night, seeking another fight, another chance to escape himself. But the longer he roamed, the more he felt like a ghost, drifting through a world that had no place for him. The darkness whispered taunts, reminding him of the horrors he had endured and the person he had become.

Returning to the shelter, he lay on the floor beside Libra, trying to find solace in her presence. But sleep eluded him, slipping away like smoke through his fingers. As the night deepened, his body betrayed him, dragging him into the depths of unconsciousness. The nightmares rushed in, a flood of torment and fear, dragging him back to Maryshka's lair, the sound of his own screams echoing in his ears.

He jerked awake, heart racing, body slick with sweat. The floor felt cold beneath him, grounding him in the present, but the ghosts lingered, mocking his futile attempts to find peace. He clenched his fists, nails digging into his palms, and took a deep breath, forcing himself to remember why he fought, why he kept moving.

Libra shifted beside him, her eyes fluttering open, searching his face for signs of the turmoil that plagued him. “Noc?” she whispered, her voice soft and reassuring.

“I’m okay,” he lied, knowing it was a façade.

*I walk this empty street*  
*On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams*  
*Where the city sleeps*  
*And I'm the only one, and I walk a-*

But as she closed her eyes and drifted back to sleep, he couldn’t help but feel the gnawing loneliness seep back in. He was a solitary warrior, battling demons no one else could see, and the weight of that isolation threatened to crush him. Each night stretched out before him, an endless expanse of darkness where he searched for meaning, for hope, but found only the haunting echoes of his past.

As he lay awake, he made a silent vow: he would not let Maryshka's shadows consume him. He would fight, not just in the ring but in every aspect of his life. For Libra, for himself, for the humanity he believed he could still reclaim. But the journey was long, and the path ahead remained shrouded in uncertainty. 

All he had were the shadows and the unrelenting weight of solitude that clung to him like a second skin.
