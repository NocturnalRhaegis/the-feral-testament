_(Age 12 – The Moment That Changes Everything)_

The front door slammed so hard the frame shook.  
Miguel barely noticed.

The newspaper bag hit the floor, forgotten, as his eyes locked onto Xavier— **blue**. Lips pale and cracked, pupils blown wide, hands clawing at nothing. **Dying.**

Miguel’s breath lodged somewhere high in his throat. He lurched forward, skidding to his knees, fumbling for the inhaler, the meds—his fingers numb, clumsy, useless—

**“No, no, no, stay with me—**”

Xavier convulsed, his small body arching. Miguel forced the inhaler against his lips, pressed the pump, counting seconds he didn’t have—

A ragged, gasping breath.  
Not enough. **Not enough.**

The phone. The **ambulance.** He scrambled for it, hands shaking so badly he nearly dropped the receiver.

**"Twelve-year-old reporting, my brother can't breathe—he's turning blue, he—just hurry—**"

His heart hammered against his ribs. The dispatcher's voice blurred—something about protocol, questions, his parents—

His **parents**.

Miguel snapped his head toward the kitchen.

His father sat, half-sunk into the couch, beer resting against his knee. He barely **turned his head**.

His mother sat by the open window, cigarette perched between her fingers, staring at nothing.

Nothing.

Miguel's voice was **hoarse**.  
**"He's—Xavier's dying!"**

A slow blink from his mother.  
His father exhaled, lips twisting in something close to irritation.

**"Well, then. Handle it."**

Just that.  
Nothing more.

Miguel felt something **fracture** inside his chest.

The sound of sirens barely registered. He scooped Xavier into his arms, bolted for the door, barely hearing his mother’s sharp inhale as she **never moved** to follow.

The EMTs met him outside, taking Xavier from his arms, strapping the oxygen mask into place—but **they didn't take Miguel.** Not really. Not in the way he needed.

They took Xavier.  
They left Miguel **alone** in the waiting room.

The fluorescent lights hummed above him, sterile and white and **empty**.

**"We can't give you medical details,"** the nurse said.  
**"You're not a guardian."**

Miguel stared at her.

Not a guardian.

Not an adult.  
Not someone who mattered.

He swallowed. His throat burned.

Something inside him **snapped**.

And the **oath**—though unspoken—etched itself into the marrow of his bones.

**If no one else will protect him, then I will.**

**The Oath to No One**

_(Age 12 – After Saving Xavier, After Being Forgotten)_

The waiting room smelled like antiseptic and old coffee. The air hummed beneath fluorescent lights too white, too cold—unforgiving in their brightness.

Miguel sat, stiff-backed in the plastic chair, hands clasped between his knees like he could hold himself together by sheer force of will. The nurses passed. The doctors murmured. No one stopped. No one looked.

Three hours.

The clock ticked **slow**, dragging time out like it wanted him to feel every second of his own helplessness.

Xavier was behind those double doors, somewhere deep in the hospital, strapped to oxygen, drowning in silence Miguel wasn’t allowed to breach. He had **saved him**, he had done **everything right**, and yet—

**"We can’t give you medical details. You’re not a guardian."**

He was **not enough**.

The words pressed into his ribs, sharp and relentless. His fingers curled into fists against his thighs. He stared down at them, at the boyish, calloused hands that held onto newspapers in the morning and his brother’s life at night.

A child’s hands.

Not a man’s.

His father hadn’t come. His mother hadn’t called. Neither had bothered to check if their son was dead or alive. It wasn’t **neglect**, not in a way the world would call criminal. It was something **quieter**. Something **worse**.

Miguel’s throat tightened.

He glanced up, toward the ceiling, at nothing—at everything. **A god he hadn’t spoken to in years, not since hope had felt like something real.**

**He spoke anyway.**

**"You listenin’, bastard?"**

The words felt too loud in the empty space of the waiting room.

Miguel exhaled, slow, measured, like he could **hold the rage down long enough to speak it properly**.

**"Fine. Listen close. You don’t care? That’s alright. That’s fair. Neither does anyone else."**

He clenched his jaw, shoulders stiff, voice steady in its quiet breaking.

**"But one day, I’m gonna matter."**

His pulse thrummed in his throat.

**"One day, people are gonna answer to me when they hurt others. They’re gonna hesitate. They’re gonna feel fear."**

His breath shuddered, but his words did not.

**"I’ll be the one they beg. The one they fear."**

He let his head fall back against the chair, eyes closing briefly.

**"I’ll be the one who stops them. And nothing—**" his voice dipped, low, final, **"—nothing will stop me."**

The promise settled deep into his bones, something heavier than the words alone.

The door swung open.

Miguel blinked once, slow, as a familiar voice cut through the sterile air.

**"Miguel—hell, kid, I didn’t know—**"

He looked up. Mrs. Daley. The neighbor. **Concern in her eyes where his parents had none.**

She was already kneeling in front of him, hands on his arms, eyes flicking over him as if checking for wounds that weren’t there.

**"You’ve been here alone this whole time?"**

He swallowed. Didn’t nod. Didn’t move.

She squeezed his arm. **"Come on. I’ll take you boys home."**

Miguel stood, shaking off the moment like it was something small, something meaningless.

But it wasn’t.

It wasn’t.
