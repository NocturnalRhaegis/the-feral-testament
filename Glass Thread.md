Verse 1
I came through a crack in the silence
Where no name followed me home
Born of shadow and defiance
Now I walk the web alone
A whisper spun in exile
A scar dressed up in lace
The world forgot my cradle
But not the venom in my grace

Chorus
I’m a thread you tried to cut
But I bind, I burn, I bend
You see chaos, I see art
You see rupture, I see mend
And though I wear my thorns like armor
Don’t mistake them for my skin
I’m just a girl who wanted shelter
In a world that won’t let me in

Verse 2
They called me too strange to follow
Too wild to let survive
But every silence I’ve swallowed
Is now the weapon I revive
I learned to dance through ashes
To laugh where mercy died
But every step still echoes
With the child I had to hide

Chorus
I’m a thread you tried to cut
But I weave, I twist, I climb
You see madness, I see memory
You see fragments, I see time
And though I strike with silk and fury
My heart’s a haunted den
Still just a girl who wanted safety
In a world that won't pretend

Bridge (soft)
Would you hold me
If I dropped the mask?
Would you stay
If the monsters asked?
I don’t want worship—I want real
But I don’t know how to feel

Final Chorus
I’m the thread that sings in silence
I’m the spark behind the veil
You see power, I see penance
You see myth—I see my jail
But if love still lingers somewhere
Let it find me in the end—
Still just a girl who wanted family
In a world that won't bend
