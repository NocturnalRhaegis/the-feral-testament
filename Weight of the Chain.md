Verse 1]
I never wanted a throne, never asked for fire
But silence breaks when the stakes get higher
Call me loyal, call me steel
I judge the wound so the world can heal

Fox at my side, raptor at my back
Truth is a weapon—never learned to act
I don’t wear lies, don’t trade in fear
I stand, I speak, and I make it clear

[Pre-Chorus] 
I’ve seen gods bleed and monsters kneel
Fought for the souls they tried to steal
I don’t forgive, I weigh the cost
Truth is the sword they thought they lost

[Chorus] 
I wear the weight of the chain
Not for glory, not for gain
You won’t see tears, but I still feel pain
I am the balance, I bear the strain

If no one else will take the blame—
Then carve the mark and speak my name
I walk the line in smoke and flame
I wear the weight of the chain

[Verse 2]
Blood runs deep in the land I left
My father sold honor, left us bereft
So I chose exile, I chose fight
And I found the Weaver in the dying light

She gave no promise, just the seal
Now I judge what’s false and what is real
I don’t break easy, I don’t look back
But I remember every heart I lack

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I’m not your savior, not your sin
But I won’t let the dark crawl in
Speak the oath, and I’ll respond
The line I walk is forged in bond

[Chorus]
I wear the weight of the chain
Not for glory, not for gain
You won’t see tears, but I still feel pain
I am the balance, I bear the strain

If no one else will take the blame—
Then carve the mark and speak my name
I walk the line in smoke and flame
I wear the weight of the chain

[Bridge] 
Judge. 
Hammer.
Stormbringer.
Foxfire flickers in the dark
Truth carves deeper than a spark
Raptor eyes see what you hide
Tell your lies—I’ll still decide

(beat drop)
Justice isn’t clean or kind—
It’s the wound you choose to bind
You think the chains will make me fold?
Nah. I carry them. I make them gold.

[Final Chorus]
I wear the weight of the chain
Not for glory, not for gain
Call me when you’ve lost your way—
I’ll draw the lines the liars fray

If no one else will take the blame—
Then carve the mark and speak my name
I walk the line in smoke and flame
I wear the weight
I wear the weight
I wear the weight of the chain
