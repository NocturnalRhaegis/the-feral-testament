Noc sat alone in a dimly lit room, the muffled sounds of the underground fight echoing from the other side of the thin walls. The clamor of fists meeting flesh, the roar of the crowd, and the sweet scent of adrenaline filled the air, but he was beyond all that noise. He was adrift in a tempest of his own making, a cacophony of regret and self-loathing.

In the shadows, he leaned against the rough brick wall, his heart racing, the weight of his past pressing down on him like a suffocating blanket. Memories clawed at him, sharp and relentless, each one a reminder of the monstrous creature he had become. He closed his eyes, trying to block out the ghosts that haunted him—the screams of his victims, the broken bodies left in his wake, the glimmer of hope extinguished with every life he had taken.

*I hurt myself today*  
*To see if I still feel*  
*I focus on the pain*  
*The only thing that's real*

Was he still a man? 
The question echoed in his mind like a relentless drum, beating against the walls of his sanity. He felt more like a weapon than a human being, a tool forged in pain and misery by the hands of Maryshka, shaped into something monstrous. Had she stolen his soul?

*The needle tears a hole*  
*The old familiar sting*  
*Try to kill it all away*  
*But I remember everything*

He remembered the first fight he’d been forced to participate in, the sheer thrill of the violence, the way it had filled the void inside him. The euphoria of being alive had masked the horror of what he was doing, but now it felt like a curse. Each punch, each victory was a reminder of the darkness that lived inside him, a beast that raged and howled beneath the surface, waiting for the moment of weakness to escape.

The lyrics of Johnny Cash's haunting song echoed in his mind. 
The irony was bitter—he was alive, yet the numbness clawed at him, as if he were merely a shell of his former self. Every fight, every victory, left him feeling more hollow, like he was losing pieces of himself in the chaos.

*What have I become?*  
*My sweetest friend*  
*Everyone I know goes away*  
*In the end*

Every day was a battle, a war waged not against external foes, but against the demons that lurked in his own mind. 

What was he fighting for? 

*And you could have it all*  
*My empire of dirt*  
*I will let you down*  
*I will make you hurt*

The question gnawed at him like a ravenous beast, stripping away his resolve. He had no clear purpose, no bright future ahead. The thought of ending it all had often crossed his mind, but then he remembered Libra, the light in his life that kept him tethered to this world. She needed him, even if he didn’t believe he deserved to be needed.

Who would protect her if he was gone?

As he stared into the darkness, his fists clenched tightly, nails digging into his palms, he felt the duality of his existence tearing him apart. The world outside demanded a fighter, a champion, but inside, he was crumbling.

“_What have I become, my sweetest friend?_” he whispered, as if the words were a prayer.

Each memory felt like a dagger, piercing through the thin veil of sanity that kept him grounded. The world around him faded, and all he could hear was the echo of his own pain, the cries of the innocent lives he had taken, the weight of his own guilt crushing him.

*I wear this crown of thorns*  
*Upon my liar's chair*  
*Full of broken thoughts*  
*I cannot repair*

Yet, there was a sliver of truth that shimmered in the darkness—a belief that he could find a way out of this labyrinth of suffering, a path that led back to himself. Even if it felt impossible, even if it felt wrong.

*Beneath the stains of time*  
*The feelings disappear*  
*You are someone else*  
*I'm still right here*

As the roars from the fight grew louder, he closed his eyes and took a deep breath, allowing the air to fill his lungs. He would fight, not just in the ring, but for his own soul. He would keep moving forward, one step at a time, against the tide of despair. He would reclaim his humanity or die trying.

“_You could have it all, my empire of dirt._” 

The truth hit him like a freight train; all the glory, the victories—none of it mattered in the face of the monster he had become. He was living in a kingdom built on pain and sorrow, and the foundations were crumbling beneath him.

*If I could start again*  
*A million miles away*  
*I would keep myself*  
*I would find a way*

In that moment of reflection, Noc resolved to remain standing, to exist in the gray between monster and man, holding onto the hope that one day, he might find a way to truly be free. His battle was far from over, but the spark of humanity flickered in the depths of his soul, daring him to fight for redemption, to prove that he was more than the sum of his scars.
