_Maryska's Watch — March 30th, 2014_

He smelled like sun-warmed copper and sweet ambition.

From the moment she first caught his scent, drifting faintly through the jungle canopy like incense smoke, Maryska was intrigued. Not afraid. Not threatened. Just… curious. Humans were usually so easy to read — base creatures driven by sex, hunger, pride, fear. But this one?

He worked alone. Bled into his research. Starved himself for progress. He was _driven_, to the point of self-erasure. _That_ was rare.

And he was so very tired. She could taste it on the air — like worn leather and burnt sugar. The kind of exhaustion that only came from someone who believed the world owed him _answers_. Someone who chased knowledge like it would save him.

How quaint.

He was beautiful in that quiet way that humans sometimes were: all sharp cheekbones, furrowed brow, and calloused hands that trembled slightly when he thought no one was looking. His notes were meticulous, his lab setup crude but functional. She read them one night, standing in the dark just beyond the firelight, watching him sleep in his hammock while her fingers traced the neat rows of data in his journals.

Bloodwork. Parasites. Spore behavior. Bacterial interactions with ancient gut flora.

_Obsessive._ Brilliant, even. But also fragile.

So fragile.

The locals warned him. She had made sure of it. She liked to watch them run. She liked how humans whispered about her — _bruja, demonio, la Dama de la Muerte_. Let them flee into the bush. She only needed _him_.

Maryska had been waiting for a moment of vulnerability. She’d considered dragging him from sleep, but there was something crude about that. No artistry. No _message_.

So when he stepped away to relieve himself, vulnerable and unaware, she smiled.

A flick of her wrist.

_Maldaldo, go._

The wolf moved like oil through water — silent, smooth, lethal. He was always eager to please. So devoted. So vicious. The perfect tool. Maryska glided after him, barefoot on stone, rising to an outcropping that gave her a perfect view of the unfolding scene below.

The boy didn’t even have time to scream at first. Not really. Maldaldo tore into him with a predator’s glee — one bite to the ribs, another to the back. Blood sprayed across the undergrowth in a beautiful arc. Red on green. Life unspooled in ribbons at her feet.

She watched dispassionately as the boy collapsed. He convulsed. Cried out. Clawed at the dirt like it might save him. His eyes bulged, his body breaking down beneath the viral storm now raging in his cells.

The bite never took. Not properly. Not unless the human had some spark buried deep — something _foul_ and _furious_ enough to grab hold of the beast and _live_. And even then, it burned them out. Almost always.

Almost.

But this one _screamed_ and _suffered_ and _bled_…

And _lived._

Maryska tilted her head. The smirk faded from her lips. Her eyes narrowed, golden and cold. She leaned forward, scenting the air — not just blood and piss and agony now, but _change_. Something old awakening. Something sharp.

He was turning.

_Turning._

She felt it ripple through the Gauntlet like a blade dragged over silk. The boy howled — high and raw and terrible — and the forest _shuddered_. Flocks scattered. The insects stopped singing. And in that sudden silence, Maryska knew:

She had found something exceptional.

Something broken, yes. Something trembling. But inside that soft academic shell was _fire_. _Spite_. _Defiance._

A survivor.

And she _loathed_ him for it.

She should have ended it there. Snapped his neck. Burned his notes. Fed him to Maldaldo and moved on.

But instead… she turned to the wolf beside her and whispered,  
“Bring him in.”

And just like that, the boy was no longer prey.

He was a _project._
