The air in the Legendary Realm was electric, buzzing with the quiet whispers of ancient spirits and revered Garou legends. Noc stood at the front of the sacred grove, his heart pounding in his chest. He scanned the faces of the guests who had gathered to witness this moment—Scion, the first of the White Howlers, his presence like a silent sentinel of history; Mistwalker, the wise and revered Wendigo shaman, ready to officiate the ceremony; and Dr. Lydia Tsien, the current leader of the Glasswalkers, her sharp eyes twinkling as she observed Noc with pride.

*If the sun refused to shine*  
*I would still be loving you*  
*If mountains crumble to the sea*  
*There will still be you and me*

*Kind lover, I give you my all*  
*Kind lover, nothing more*

But among them all, one face stood out, one presence that held a weight Noc couldn’t fully describe. Red’s mother. He had found her just in time, deep within the Legendary Realm, where she had been drawn by the mysteries of the world beyond death. Her arrival had been a delicate matter, but Noc had promised himself—promised Red—that he would do everything in his power to give Red the closure he never thought possible. And now, here she was, a witness to a union long in the making.

Noc’s gaze shifted to Red, standing beside him, his hand gripping Noc’s tightly. Red looked more nervous than Noc had ever seen him, shifting on his feet, his eyes darting around as if searching for an escape. Noc squeezed his hand, a silent reassurance, feeling Red’s tension ease ever so slightly. Red hated the spotlight, hated being the center of attention, and the thought of standing before such legendary figures, with all eyes on him, had nearly sent him running.

But he hadn’t run.

*Little drops of rain whisper of the pain*  
*Tears of loves lost in the days gone by*  
*My love is strong*  
*With you there is no wrong*  
*Together we shall go until we die, my, my, my*  

Instead, he had closed the distance between them, placing his trust—and his heart—in Noc’s hands.

As the ceremony began, Mistwalker’s voice rose, ancient words carried on the wind, speaking of love, unity, and the power of the bond between mates. Noc barely heard him, his attention entirely on Red, who stood beside him, his breathing slow and steady, though Noc could sense the anxious energy vibrating beneath the surface.

*An inspiration is what you are to me*  
*Inspiration - look, see*

When it was time for Noc to speak, he turned fully to Red, his heart swelling with so much love that he wasn’t sure he’d be able to find the words. But as he looked into Red’s eyes, the memories of their years together washed over him—the good, the bad, the messy, and the beautiful. And the words came.

“Red,” Noc began, his voice soft but carrying through the sacred grove. “I’ve spent so much of my life trying to find my place, trying to understand who I am and what I’m meant for. I’ve fought demons, both literal and those within me, and I’ve known the pain of loss and abandonment.”

He paused, his voice catching for a moment as he thought of his own painful past. “But then I found you. And with you, I found peace. I found the kind of love that makes all the battles worth fighting, the kind of love that gives me the strength to keep going.”

*And so today, my world, it smiles*  
*Your hand in mine, we walk the miles*  
*And thanks to you it will be done*  
*For you to me are the only one*  
*All right, yeah*

Red’s eyes softened, his grip on Noc’s hand tightening as Noc continued.

“I’ve never been the kind of person to put my trust in others easily. But you, Red... you are the exception. You’ve seen me at my worst, and yet you’ve stood by my side. You’ve been my friend, my confidante, my partner in all things. And now... you’ll be my mate. My husband.”

Noc’s voice grew more fervent as he spoke. “There is nothing I wouldn’t do for you. No sacrifice too great, no challenge too difficult, if it means your happiness. You’ve given me more than I ever thought I deserved, and I will spend the rest of my days proving to you that your trust in me was not misplaced.”

A small smile tugged at the corners of Noc’s lips as he added, “And of course, I’ll keep making sure we get into a little bit of mischief now and then. It’s tradition at this point.”

A soft ripple of laughter spread through the gathered guests, but Noc barely heard it. His world was Red, and Red alone.

“In all seriousness,” Noc continued, his voice steady once more, “I promise you my love, my support, and my devotion. For the rest of our days, I will be by your side. I am yours, Red. Completely. Forever.”

*Happiness, no more be sad*  
*Happiness - I'm glad*

Red blinked rapidly, clearly overwhelmed by the emotion of the moment, his cheeks flushed a deep red. When it was his turn to speak, he hesitated for a moment, glancing at the ground, then back at Noc.

“Well,” Red began awkwardly, his voice rough with nerves, “what he said.”

There was a beat of silence, and then, as one, the crowd burst into warm, affectionate laughter. Even Noc chuckled, shaking his head with affection. That was Red. Always simple, always straightforward.

But then Red’s voice dropped, and he squeezed Noc’s hand with a seriousness that made Noc’s breath catch.

“I love you, Noc,” Red said, his voice low and full of emotion. “I don’t have fancy words like you, but I do know this: I wouldn’t be standing here if it wasn’t for you. You’ve given me everything—everything I didn’t even know I needed. And I promise you, I’ll spend the rest of my life making sure you know how much you mean to me. I’m yours. Always.”

Noc’s heart swelled as he pulled Red into a kiss, sealing their vows in front of the legends of their kind, in front of Red’s mother, in front of the spirits of the world who bore witness to their love.

*If the sun refused to shine
*I would still be loving you*  
*When mountains crumble to the sea
*There will still be you and me*

As the ceremony ended and the celebrations began, Noc couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of contentment, a feeling of completeness that he hadn’t known was possible. The Stag Hunt, led by Cernunnos himself, was a roaring success, the perfect end to an unforgettable day. But even as the night stretched on, and the laughter and revelry filled the air, Noc’s mind remained on one thing—one person.

Red.

His partner, his mate, his love.

And as they prepared to leave for their honeymoon, Noc glanced at Red, his heart full, knowing that no matter what challenges the future held, they would face them together.

Because in this moment, in this life, Noc had found his place.

And it was with Red. Forever.
