## **TRAUMA TIMELINE SIGNIFICANCE**

**31 YEARS** of buried trauma (2014-2045) before Noc finally tells the truth about:
- The silver collar that "burned so deep it fused into the muscle"
- Killing Alexander and 40+ others in captivity
- Never telling Red the full story despite 17 years together
- Never telling Seras despite 27+ years of fatherhood

The 2045 revelation represents the moment when decades of family love built on incomplete information finally confronts the complete truth.

## **NARRATIVE STRUCTURE**

Your timeline creates a **perfect three-act structure**:

**Act I**: Trauma & Transformation (2014-2015)  
**Act II**: Recovery & Love (2015-2024)  
**Act III**: Truth & Revelation (2025-2045+)

The 53-year-old Noc who finally speaks his truth in 2045 has carried these secrets for **over half his life**. The weight of that silence, and the explosive power of finally breaking it, gives incredible emotional resonance to "The Collar at the Table" scene.
