[Verse 1]
Raised in shadows, never quite home,
A lone wolf lost where the kitties roam.
The night came calling with twisted hands—
Left its mark no light withstands.

[Verse 2]
They branded me, tried to steal my soul,
But I fought hard to keep it whole.
A wound that aches but will not break—
A pain that time cannot unmake.

[Chorus]
I carry the wound that never heals,
A ghost beneath the scars I feel.
But in the dark, you found my name—
Pulled me back from the edge of flame.

[Verse 3]
You saw the cracks no one could find,
Held the light inside my mind.
We walk this path, broken but true—
Two lost souls who made it through.

[Chorus Repeat]
I carry the wound that never heals,
A ghost beneath the scars I feel.
But in the dark, you found my name—
Pulled me back from the edge of flame.

[Spoken Bridge – intimate, low tone]
“I’m no hero.
No savior of light.
Just a man with a scar that never fades—
A shadow that walks beside me always.
But you… you kept the darkness at bay.
And for that, I carry you in my breath.”

[Final Chorus – soft, steady]
I carry the wound that never heals,
A ghost beneath the scars I feel.
But in the dark, you found my name—
Pulled me back from the edge of flame.
