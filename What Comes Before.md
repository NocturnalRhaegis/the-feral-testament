### _The Whisper and the Spark_

The night smelled of myrrh and scorched ink.

Maryska stood alone in her sanctum, surrounded by half-finished corpses and prayers. Candles guttered against the weight of silence, the kind that pressed down like a blanket soaked in water. The air was _too still_, and for once, she wasn't talking to herself.

She was listening.

And then—he was there.

Or something like him.

A shape, more void than form, peeled away from the corner shadows like oil lifting from old stone. No sound. No heartbeat. Not even the breath of intention. Just a presence that _coiled_ in her thoughts like cold wire.

It didn’t introduce itself.

It didn’t have to.

The figure held out a small, black case. Old. Sealed in wax and sigils burned in languages no one spoke aloud anymore.

When she reached for it, its hand didn’t move—just hovered, waiting.

She took the case.

And then a voice, low and slow, like gravity whispering through the bones of the earth:

**“You were never meant to raise the god. You were meant to test the vessel.”**

Then it was gone.

The room exhaled again. Candles flared back to life. The corpses resumed their slow decomposition.

Maryska stood alone with the case. And for the first time in centuries, she hesitated.

But only for a moment.

She broke the seal with her teeth.

Inside: blood samples. Tissues. Fully sequenced genome strands. Names.

**Miguel Rhaegis.**  
**Red Knight.**

She remembered Rhaegis from an old thesis that circulated the underground bioethics circles—**a ridiculous little thing**, all theory and messianic idealism. Something about werewolves as evolutionary protectors, spiritual stewards, ecological keystones. He had called them “custodians of entropy.” He’d been **mocked**, of course. Called naïve.

But _she_ hadn’t laughed.

Because she’d recognized something in him that none of his peers had.

**Conviction.**

The kind that either died young—or burned its way into legend.

And Red?

The pup that walked like a man and made war look like ballet.

They were beautiful, both of them. _Tragic and inevitable._

And now their code was hers.

Maryska laughed then—a sharp, joyous sound.

Oh, how delicious the irony. The savior and the soldier. The boy who wanted to heal the world and the wild child.

**And she would break them with science.**

Not Lilith. Not yet.

Lilith could wait.

**Months Later**

She stood on the edge of the Amazon, watching the fireflies gather like souls around the perimeter of her camp. Maldaldo beside her, silent as always, blade at his back, blood in his teeth.

Miguel Rhaegis was out there.

So small.

So wounded.

So **perfectly alone.**

Maryska smiled.

Time to collect.
