**The Jungle Watches—And So Does She**

_(The locals left. She stayed. And now, he is hers to unravel.)_

The jungle **never stopped watching**.

Neither did she.

Miguel Rhaegis had spent **eight days alone**, surviving on little more than stale coffee and the relentless demands of his research.

There had been **warnings**, hushed words from the locals, hands gripping his forearm **too tightly** as they urged him to **leave before the moon grew full**.

He had ignored them.

_"Folklore. Superstition."_

That’s what he told himself as he cataloged blood samples, recorded environmental shifts, tracked the dietary habits of a haplogroup long forgotten by modern anthropology.

He was meticulous.

Precise.

**Blind.**

He never felt the moment the jungle **stopped breathing around him**.

Never noticed when the **whisper of insects died off**, when the scent of damp earth became **overpowered by something else**.

Not until the last of the locals **packed their things and vanished**.

They did not say goodbye.

Just a glance—one final look of **pity, of quiet resignation**, before the trees swallowed them.

And then he was **alone**.

That night, as he crouched near the firepit, washing sweat from his face with water so stale it reeked of tin, **she stood on an outcropping above him**, watching.

She had been watching for days.

At first, it was **idle interest**.

Then, **curiosity**.

Now, something else.

She crouched, resting one elbow on her knee, chin tilted downward, her eyes **glinting softly under the haze of smoke drifting upward from his fire**.

**"This one is different."**

Maldaldo shifted at her side, silent. Waiting. **The predator was patient.**

She wasn’t speaking to him.

She was speaking to herself.

She hadn’t expected Rhaegis to last this long. **She hadn’t expected him to keep pushing forward when everything around him had started screaming warnings.**

And yet, **he did**.

Fascinating.

Her fingers curled tighter around the stone beneath her.

She could **see it now**, the tension lining his body, the exhaustion leaking into his movements, the dark smudges under his eyes **from too many nights spent ignoring the whisper of danger**.

It was **delicious**.

There was nothing special about humans who wandered too deep. Nothing remarkable about the ones who didn’t heed the warnings.

They died.

Always.

But this one...

This one had survived **longer than expected**.

And that made her wonder.

**Could he survive the bite?**

No one did.

Not fully. Not without **breaking into something lesser, something shattered, something easy to control.**

But still, she watched.

Still, she lingered.

And when the night finally came—when Maldaldo finally moved, when claws finally raked through flesh and tendon—she would be waiting.

Just to see.

Just to watch.

Because now, she needed to **know**.
