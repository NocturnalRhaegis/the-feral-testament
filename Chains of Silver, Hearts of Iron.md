The walls didn’t change. Same lightless stone. Same rot-slick corners. Same rhythmic drip of distant water that might once have been a heartbeat. Days and nights bled into each other until even time itself lost the will to count. Noc lay on the floor, shackled at wrist and ankle, body wrecked and mind worse.

The silver in the chains didn’t just burn—it took. It drank his strength, sapped his rage, hollowed him out like a fruit picked too late. Beside him, Red lay curled into himself, bones showing beneath skin, eyes sunken but still watching. Always watching.

For a while, they endured together.

Then the council separated them. One thought they’d outwit the bond between two warriors—two wolves—with doors and distance. Noc heard Red’s screams the first night, and something in him died.

Then something else rose.

He didn't shift. He transcended. Through searing silver, through every nerve on fire, he became fury incarnate. Guards died. Rooms were painted in gore. The council learned quickly: the monsters they feared couldn’t be broken apart. Not without paying in blood.

They kept them together after that.

But months passed. The cruelty never did.

Noc started to slip.

He didn’t know when it began. The dreams maybe, of the Pit, of Maryska’s voice dripping down the stone like poison honey. The taste of ash in his mouth. The scent of fear he knew too well—his own.

One night, Red spoke.

“I know where you’re going,” he whispered, voice rasped to the point of cracking. “I know that look, Noc.”

Silence. Just that steady, blank stare at the wall.

“You’re leaving me,” Red said.

Still nothing.

Red took a ragged breath. “I’m tired, Noc. I don’t want to fight anymore. If you give up, I do too.”

A muscle in Noc’s jaw twitched.

“Let me go.”

It was so soft. So final.

And it hit like a silver bullet straight through the soul.

Red, the boy who’d bled for him, walked beside him through fire and worse, Red who never folded, never wavered—was breaking.

That did what months of torment couldn’t. It cut through the fog like a howl through silence.

Noc blinked.

Turned his head.

Met Red’s eyes.

“I see you,” he said. Voice hoarse. Barely audible. “You’re trying to leave me. You can’t. You promised.”

And there it was.

Red’s breath hitched. The faintest curl of his lip—just enough of a smile to be a spark.

“I did,” he murmured. “So don’t make a liar out of me, wolf.”

They didn’t break them.

No, they just reminded them why they fight.
