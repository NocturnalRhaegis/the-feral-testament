The moment Noc realized the extent of Red's injuries was a stark, gut-wrenching blow. They had been fighting alongside each other, facing the horrors of the Upside Down together. But when Red collapsed, the realization of the gravity of his wounds hit Noc like a wave. The sight of his friend, once so vibrant and full of life, lying motionless and bleeding, was a shock to his system.

As he knelt beside Red, trying to staunch the bleeding, Noc felt a surge of panic. He had never experienced such a visceral fear before, not even when held at Maryshkaâ€™s hands. The thought of losing Red was unbearable. It was in that moment, amidst the chaos and the desperation, that Noc truly acknowledged the depth of his feelings.

*I'm going under and I fear this time there's no one to save me*  
*This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy*  
*I need somebody to heal*  
*Somebody to know*  
*Somebody to have*  
*Somebody to hold*  
*It's easy to say, but it's never the same*  
*I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain*

He had always admired Red, respected him as a companion, and valued their friendship. But it was in this crisis, when the possibility of losing Red was so imminent, that Noc realized the true nature of his emotions. His love for Red was more than just companionship; it was a deep, abiding affection that went beyond words.

Noc's heart pounded in his chest as he fought to keep Red alive. He called out for help, his voice filled with urgency. But as he worked to save his friend, he knew that he was also facing a personal reckoning. He had to confront his own feelings and accept the truth of his love for Red.

As Noc knelt beside Red, his heart pounded against his ribs like a trapped bird. The world seemed to shrink to a single, terrifying point: the sight of his friend, his life, slipping away. The once vibrant hues of the Upside Down faded into a bleak, monochromatic canvas, mirroring the despair that consumed Noc.

*And now the day bleeds into nightfall*  
*And you're not here to get me through it all*  
*I let my guard down*  
*And you pulled the rug*  
*I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved*

The realization of Red's critical condition was a dagger twisting deep within Noc's soul. He had always been a solitary figure, a wanderer in a world that seemed to constantly shift and change. But now, with the threat of losing Red, that loneliness felt amplified, a crushing weight that threatened to swallow him whole.

The thought of a life without Red was a terrifying prospect. He had found solace and purpose in their companionship, a connection that had helped to fill the void within him. Without Red, Noc felt adrift, a ghost haunting a world that no longer seemed to have a place for him.

*I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to*  
*This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you*
*Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear*  
*Somebody to have, just to know how it feels*  
*It's easy to say, but it's never the same*  
*I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape*

As he watched Red's life ebbing away, Noc experienced a profound sense of hopelessness. The future, once filled with promise and possibility, now seemed bleak and uncertain. He was haunted by the vision of a world without Red, a place where laughter and joy were replaced by an endless, echoing silence.

The weight of his loneliness was almost unbearable. It was a heavy, suffocating presence that seemed to permeate every aspect of his being. Noc felt as if he were drowning in a sea of despair, his cries for help lost in the vast, indifferent universe.

As Red lay motionless, a medical team rushed to his aid. Their faces were etched with concern as they worked feverishly to stabilize him. The urgency of the situation was palpable, and every second felt like an eternity.

*Now, the day bleeds into nightfall*
*And you're not here to get me through it all*  
*I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug*
*I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved*

With delicate precision, the surgeons began the arduous task of repairing the damaged nerves in Red's spinal column. Their hands moved with a practiced grace, each stitch a testament to their skill. Noc watched from a distance, his heart pounding in his chest. He felt a deep sense of helplessness, unable to do anything but pray for Red's recovery.

To speed the healing process, the doctors forced a shapeshift, a risky procedure that could have serious consequences. Noc stayed by Red's side, his hand clasped tightly around his friend's. He watched as Red's body contorted and changed, his skin taking on a shimmering, iridescent hue.

The tension in the room was palpable as everyone waited for the outcome of the surgery. Noc held his breath, his mind racing with a thousand possibilities. He knew that if Red lost his legs, he might give up entirely. The thought was unbearable, and Noc begged every deity he could think of for help.

Finally, the surgeons stepped away from the operating table, their faces etched with a mixture of relief and uncertainty. They had managed to stabilize Red, but the extent of his paralysis remained to be seen. Noc's heart pounded in his chest as he waited for the doctors' verdict.

As the minutes ticked by, the tension in the room grew almost unbearable. Noc paced back and forth, his mind racing with a thousand fears. In a desperate plea for mercy, he called out to the old gods and the new, his voice broken with emotion. Tears streamed down his face as he begged for a miracle.

*And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes*  
*I fall into your arms*  
*I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around*
  
*For now, the day bleeds into nightfall*
*And you're not here to get me through it all]*
*I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug*
*I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved*


Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Red's eyes fluttered open. Noc's heart leaped into his throat.

Relief washed over him as he saw that his friend was alive.

"I'm hungry," Red rasped, his voice weak.

Noc's relief was so overwhelming that he couldn't help but sob. He fell to his knees beside Red, his muscled frame shaking with emotion. The fear and despair that had consumed him were replaced by an immense gratitude. Red was alive, and that was all that mattered.

*But now the day bleeds into nightfall*  
*And you're not here to get me through it all*  
*I let my guard down*  
*And you pulled the rug*  
*I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved*

*But now the day bleeds into nightfall*  
*And you're not here to get me through it all*  
*I let my guard down*  
*And you pulled the rug*  
*I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved*

*I let my guard down*  
*And you pulled the rug*  
*I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved*
