Los Alamos, New Mexico – Age 14

The sound of the plate hitting the floor was Miguel’s cue. Ceramic shattered against tile like a gunshot. Forks skittered. His father’s chair scraped back.

Miguel was already on his feet. "Nice job, genius," he snapped, stepping between his little brother and the coming storm. “You need instructions now to hold a plate?”

It was enough. The attention shifted. The monster turned.

He didn’t remember what he said next. He rarely did. The goal wasn’t clarity—it was volume. It was friction. Anything to derail the train before it crushed Xavier.

The first hit always knocked the words out of him. The rest blurred together.

Miguel Rhaegis grew up in a house where silence was survival. Where the air was thick with resentment and sweat, and God watched from a cross nailed to yellowing wallpaper, silent as ever.

His father was a machinist—angry, exhausted, always one beer short of violent. His mother was less than a ghost. She floated from room to room, eyes unfocused, fingers stained with cigarette smoke and detachment. She never stopped him. She never stopped anything.

But Miguel? Miguel stopped what he could.

He stopped his father from turning Xavier into a corpse. Stopped himself from screaming until his lungs collapsed. Stopped time, when he could, by burying himself in things that made sense—molecular biology, theoretical math, obscure physics forums full of strangers who didn’t ask about bruises.

He was an honor roll student before he could explain why mitochondria mattered. Chess club captain, AV club nerd, three grades ahead in math. Because the longer he stayed after school, the less time he spent at home.

Friends were liabilities. He didn’t bring anyone over. Ever. How do you explain to someone that the yelling isn’t the worst part? That it’s the long, echoing silence after that breaks you?

So Miguel kept his head down and his mind sharp. Rage became focus. Hopelessness became obsession. And every time he watched Xavier struggle to breathe, every time his brother’s hands trembled trying to hold a spoon, Miguel made himself another promise.

I will save him. I will fix this. I don’t care what I have to become.

That was the first vow. The clean one. The one made in science labs and sleepless nights. The one made before fangs and fury, before chains and slave pits. Before gods whispered back.

Back when he was still just a boy with too much brain and nowhere to put it, except in service of the only person who had ever mattered.
