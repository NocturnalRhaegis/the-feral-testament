The jungle was alive, a symphony of chirps and rustles, the air thick with the scent of earth and damp leaves. Noc Rhaegis sat alone in a clearing, the full moon bathing the world in an ethereal glow. Just days out of the hospital, the memory of the bite still fresh on his skin—a cruel reminder of the night his life changed forever. The natives who had guided him back to the jungle had returned to their village, leaving him isolated, vulnerable, and unprepared for the horror that awaited him.

As the moonlight peaked above the trees, it ignited something primal within him, a hunger and a longing he couldn’t comprehend. A sudden jolt of pain radiated through his slender body, causing him to gasp. The transformation had begun.

Muscles contorted beneath his skin, twisting and pulling like living serpents. Tendons stretched as if to snap, bones cracked and reformed, the sound echoing in the stillness around him. He fell to the ground, convulsing, fighting against the agony that surged through him like wildfire. Each scream was a raw, tortured cry that sliced through the jungle’s night, a symphony of suffering.

High on a hill, concealed by the shadows, Maryshka Nightfire watched, her dark eyes gleaming with sadistic pleasure. She reveled in his torment, the way his screams echoed in the stillness, a haunting melody that only she could appreciate. She licked her lips, savoring the anticipation, intoxicated by the unfolding chaos.

As the moon reached its zenith, the pain reached a crescendo. Noc writhed, every fiber of his being stretched to its limit. He felt the wildness surge, the beast clawing to the surface, eager to escape the confines of his humanity. It was as if his soul was being torn apart, divided between man and wolf, each fighting for dominance.

Finally, with a bone-chilling howl that reverberated through the clearing, the transformation completed its merciless grip on him. He collapsed to the ground, panting, his senses heightened, the world alive with vibrant colors and smells. He looked up, breathless, and saw the silhouette of a wolf standing at the edge of the thicket, its eyes glinting with an intelligence that sent a shiver down his spine.

Before he could process the threat, the great wolf—Maldaldo—leapt into the clearing, a dark shadow against the silver light. In an instant, he felt sharp teeth grip the back of his neck, a primal instinct overwhelming him as he was dragged into the underbrush. The forest closed in around him, the cacophony of sounds muted as terror washed over him.

Maryshka emerged from the shadows, a ghostly figure in the moonlight, her smile wide and wicked. “Welcome to your new life, my beautiful beast,” she purred, her voice dripping with dark honey. “You belong to me now, Noc. This pain is only the beginning.”

With a swift, practiced motion, she fastened a silver collar around his throat, the metal biting into his flesh with a snap of finality. He felt the chill of the silver against his skin, a harsh reminder of his new reality.

“You will learn to love the darkness,” she continued, her gaze unwavering, each word weaving a sinister spell around him. “You will become my weapon, my favorite plaything. The world will know fear, and it will start with you.”

Noc thrashed against the constraints, rage igniting within him. But deep down, he understood the gravity of his situation. He was no longer just a man. The beast within had been unleashed, and he was ensnared in a web of manipulation and power.

In that moment of despair, he realized the transformation was not just physical; it was a shift that would alter the course of his life forever. With Maryshka’s laughter ringing in his ears and the weight of the collar heavy around his neck, he knew he would have to fight not only for his freedom but for his very soul.
