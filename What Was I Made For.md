The moonlight filtered dimly through the cloud-filled sky, casting a cold, silvery hue over the room. The weight of the world seemed to press down on Nocturnal Rhaegis as he sat alone by the window, the distant echo of raindrops tapping gently against the glass. His amber eyes, usually filled with sharp focus or silent rage, were distant now, clouded like the skies above. He stared into the gray expanse, lost in the heaviness of his thoughts.

Billie Eilish's haunting voice whispered through the room from a speaker on the nightstand, her lyrics sinking into Noc’s chest like a blade that twisted deeper with each word.

*I used to float, now I just fall down*  
*I used to know but I'm not sure now*  
*What I was made for*  
*What was I made for?*

*Takin' a drive, I was an ideal*  
*Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real*  
*Just something you paid for*  
*What was I made for?*

He hadn’t smiled in days, maybe weeks. And now, with Red Knight sleeping peacefully behind him, he wondered if he ever truly would again. His breath hitched as the song continued, speaking to a part of him he rarely let see the light of day.

*'Cause I, I*  
*I don't know how to feel*  
*But I wanna try*  
*I don't know how to feel*  
*But someday, I might*  
*Someday, I might*

Was this love? Could someone as broken as him—someone who had killed, bled, and suffered so much—ever deserve to feel warmth? To feel safe? Noc dragged his fingers through his unruly hair, trying to find comfort in the physical motion, but all he felt was a gnawing emptiness. His body ached with the absence of something he couldn’t name, as though he were hollow beneath his skin.

*When did it end? All the enjoyment*  
*I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend*  
*It's not what he's made for*  
*What was I made for?*

The song resonated in ways he didn’t want to admit. He had spent so long surviving, so long suppressing everything that made him human, that he didn’t know how to want anything beyond survival anymore. Even now, with Red in his life, the shadow of fear loomed. Fear of losing him. Fear of not being enough. Fear of not knowing how to love him the way he deserved.

Noc blinked back the burning in his eyes. He clenched his jaw, swallowing against the lump rising in his throat. He couldn’t let himself cry. Not now. Not with Red so close. He had to be the strong one, the protector. But the lyrics swirled through his mind, over and over—_What was I made for?_—a question he had asked himself so many times before, but never with such intensity, never with such despair.

A soft sigh escaped Red from the bed behind him, and Noc's heart clenched painfully. He turned, his gaze drawn back to the figure curled beneath the blankets, the rise and fall of Red’s chest steady and comforting. He was safe. Noc had fought to keep him safe. But the thought that he might not be enough, that Red might see through the cracks in his façade and find the beast inside, tore at him.

*'Cause I, I*  
*I don't know how to feel*  
*But I wanna try*  
*I don't know how to feel*  
*But someday, I might*  
*Someday, I might*

With a soft, trembling exhale, Noc stood and crossed the room. His bare feet were silent on the floor as he slipped under the covers, feeling the cold sting of his own body. Red stirred slightly as Noc pressed his chest to his back, curling around him like a shield, but also like something fragile and desperate, needing the warmth that only Red could give.

*Think I forgot how to be happy*  
*Something I'm not, but something I can be*  
*Something I wait for*  
*Something I'm made for*  
*Something I'm made for*

Noc buried his face in the space between Red’s shoulder blades, inhaling the familiar scent of him, grounding himself in the present. But still, the cold remained—a chill that gnawed at his soul, something that no amount of closeness could banish. He felt like he might never be warm again, no matter how tightly he held on.

But he held on anyway.
