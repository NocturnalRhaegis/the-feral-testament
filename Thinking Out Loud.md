The heavy humidity of the Louisiana air hung like a weight over Nocturnal Rhaegis as he sat on the old, weather-worn bench within the caern. Moss draped the trees in the distance, and the hum of cicadas filled the silence between him and Red Knight. The tension between them, however, was more oppressive than the southern heat. Noc could feel it crackling, and it wasn’t the first time the two had been at odds. But this felt different.

*When your legs don't work like they used to before*  
*And I can't sweep you off of your feet*

*Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?*  
*Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?*

Red’s arms were crossed, his eyes blazing with fury. He was pacing like a caged animal, and Noc could see the fight Red was having within himself—to stay calm or to let his temper fly. Noc sighed, mentally preparing for whatever was coming, but the words of defense he'd crafted in his mind felt useless in the face of Red’s growing anger. His chest tightened.

“You need to stop this,” Red finally snapped, the anger in his voice barely restrained. “You’ve been reckless for as long as I’ve known you, throwing yourself into danger without a second thought, acting like it doesn’t matter if you come out the other side.”

Noc shifted in his seat, staring at the dirt under his boots. He had heard this speech before, from Red and others. He couldn’t help who he was—someone willing to lay down his life to protect others. It was who he'd always been. But Red wasn’t finished. His voice, already deep, rose in pitch.

*And, darling, I will*  
*Be loving you 'til we're 70*

*And, baby, my heart*  
*Could still fall as hard at 23*

“Do you even realize how hard it is for the rest of us to watch you do that?” Red’s voice cracked, filled with both fury and concern. “How hard it is for _me_? We just made vows, Noc! You swore you’d be at my side, and yet every time we step into a fight, I’m scared out of my mind that it’ll be the last time I see you.”

Noc clenched his fists. “I’m not trying to get myself killed, Red. You know I—"

“_Don’t you dare_,” Red interrupted, slamming his hand on the back of the bench, causing it to groan under the pressure. “You’re not just putting your own life on the line, you’re putting mine on it too. We’re a pack, we’re mated for life. You can’t keep acting like you’re expendable.”

*And I'm thinking 'bout how*

*People fall in love in mysterious ways*  
*Maybe just the touch of a hand*  
*Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day*  
*And I just wanna tell you I am*

*So, honey, now*  
*Take me into your loving arms*

*Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars*  
*Place your head on my beating heart*  
*I'm thinking out loud*  
*Maybe we found love right where we are*

Noc fell silent, guilt rising in his chest. Red’s words cut deep. He’d spent his whole life throwing himself in harm’s way, shielding others from pain or death—his own worth be damned. In his mind, that was what a hero did. That was what made up for the monster lurking inside him.

But Red wasn’t finished. “You’re my mate. That means something, and I won’t stand by while you keep acting like your life doesn’t matter. You want to sacrifice yourself for something? Fine. But do it for _us_. Not to punish yourself for something that doesn’t even need redemption.”

Noc blinked, stunned. Red’s voice was hard but trembled with emotion. The deeper meaning behind his words hung heavily in the air. For so long, Noc had been driven by the belief that his life was forfeit. He’d fought his bestial nature, rejected his right to happiness, and saw himself as a tool for violence and protection. But now, hearing Red say it… _punishing himself_… it hit home in a way it hadn’t before.

Red stepped in front of him, his hands on his hips, his breath coming in labored spurts as he worked to calm himself. When he spoke again, his voice had dropped, a low, guttural growl that was laced with pain. “You don’t get it, do you? Your life isn’t just yours anymore. You don’t get to decide when it ends. You don’t get to decide that you’re less important than anyone else. Not anymore.”

*When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades*  
*And the crowds don't remember my name*  
*When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mhm*  
*I know you will still love me the same*

*'Cause, honey, your soul*  
*Could never grow old, it's evergreen*

*And, baby, your smile's*  
*Forever in my mind and memory*  
*I'm thinking 'bout how*

Noc raised his head to meet Red’s eyes. For the first time in a long while, he couldn’t find the words to argue. Red crouched down in front of him, putting them at eye level, his tone softer but still firm. “You think you need redemption. You don’t. You never did. You’ve always been worthy, Noc. You’ve always been a hero to the people who matter—to me, to the pack.”

Noc’s throat tightened. Red had a way of cutting to the core of things, stripping away every defense Noc had built around himself. He wanted to look away, to turn and hide from the truth in Red’s words. But Red wouldn’t let him. He reached out and grabbed Noc’s hand, squeezing it tightly. “I love you, you idiot. And I’m not about to let you keep hurting yourself because you think it’s what you deserve.”

*People fall in love in mysterious ways*  
*And maybe it's all part of a plan*  
*Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes*  
*Hoping that you'll understand*

*That, baby, now*  
*Take me into your loving arms*

*Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars*  
*Place your head on my beating heart*  
*I'm thinking out loud*  
*And maybe we found love right where we are, oh-oh*

Noc’s breath hitched as Red’s words sank in. There was no judgment in Red’s voice, only fierce, unyielding love. It was the love of a mate, of a partner, and of someone who refused to let Noc fall apart. For so long, Noc had fought his battles alone. But now… now there was someone else beside him, someone who saw him not as a broken thing needing redemption but as a man who was whole.

Red squeezed Noc’s hand again, pulling him out of his thoughts. His voice was quiet but filled with an intensity that made Noc’s chest ache. “You’re not alone anymore. Your life, your pain, your fights—they’re mine too. So stop throwing yourself in the fire like you don’t matter. Because you do. To me, to the pack, to everyone who knows you.”

*So, baby, now*  
*Take me into your loving arms*  
*Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars*  
*Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart*  
*I'm thinking out loud*  
*That maybe we found love right where we are*

For the first time in what felt like years, Noc allowed himself to feel the weight of those words. He wasn’t just a beast or a fighter. He wasn’t just someone to shield others. He was someone who mattered, and his life had value—because it was shared.

He took a deep breath, nodding slowly as Red’s hand remained clasped around his. “I hear you,” he said, his voice hoarse but steady. “I… I get it.”

Red smiled faintly, though his eyes were still hard. “Good. Now start acting like it.”

*Oh, baby, we found love right where we are*  
*And we found love right where we are*

For the first time in a long while, Noc felt something in him ease. His life was no longer about punishment or redemption. It was about the people he loved and the ones who loved him in return. And maybe, just maybe, that was enough.
