_(Noc & His Father – Los Alamos, The Final Stand-Off)_

The air in Los Alamos hasn’t changed.

Still that sterile, sun-bleached sharpness of a town built to contain **secrets**. Only now, it’s his secrets the air seems to whisper. The scent of pine and scorched rock is wrapped around the smell of ghosts.

Noc stands at the curb, Red at his side, the translator’s contact info flickering on the phone in Red’s hand like it knows this isn’t just a **pit stop**.

Across the street stands the house.

**That house.**

Its siding is sun-bleached, the windows hazy with the grime of years, and yet the door is freshly painted. The porch is intact. A **tire swing still hangs, deflated and forgotten**, like some dead thing left to rot in daylight.

Red leans close. **“He’s here, isn’t he?”**

Noc doesn’t answer. Doesn’t blink. The house holds him like a snare.

Then the door opens.

**And time collapses.**

The man who steps outside is **older**, **grayer**, shoulders bowed with the slow corrosion of **regretless years**—but his eyes are **the same**. That same judgmental sharpness. That same **chill**.

At first, **confusion**. Then…

**Recognition.**  
And with it, **revulsion**. As if Noc were a stray dog pissing on the welcome mat.

Red breathes in slow through his nose. **“I’ll go find the translator.”**

Noc nods without looking away. **“Don’t let him see you.”**

**“You sure?”**

**“Positive.”**

Red goes, his steps crisp, controlled. Like a man **walking out of a storm and leaving the thunder behind**.

Noc walks across the street.

They **stare** at each other. No words at first.

Then:

**“You’re still alive,” his father says flatly.**

Noc lets out a bitter laugh. **“Surprise.”**

**“What do you want?”**

Noc exhales, slow. His voice is **measured**, but his pulse **is not**. **“I want to know if you ever regretted it.”**

The corners of his father’s mouth pull **downward**, unimpressed. **“Regretted what? Throwing out trash?”**

Noc **doesn’t flinch**. He just **watches**. Weighs it. Feels the choice **press against his ribs**—does he keep trying? Does he let silence win?

He shifts his stance. **“You could’ve had a son. A real one. Someone who cared about you. Hell, someone who still could.”**

His father sneers, sharp as broken glass. **"You’re no son of mine."**

**Pause. A breath held too long.**

Noc inhales, slow. Doesn’t answer. The choice lingers—**bite back or let it die**.

Then—

**Crack!**

The sound **splits the sky**.

A flash. A shot **meant for monsters**.

His father **screams**. Clutches his arm. Blood **spills**. And he **runs**.

Noc doesn’t chase. He just **watches** the stain his father leaves behind.

The moment **hangs**, tension hollowed out into silence.

Then—he makes the call.

Hours later, the **lot is stripped bare**. Bulldozers. Dump trucks. Magic-infused muscle and favors owed.

The house is **gone**. Just **gone**.

Where it stood, soft grass rolls in the moonlight. A single red flower **grows**, fast and impossibly wild, from the scorched patch of earth where the porch once stood.

Red returns as dawn starts to stretch its fingers across the sky. He says **nothing**. Just slides his arm around Noc’s waist.

Noc breathes in deep. Lets it out.

**“Guess I’m homeless again,”** he mutters, the edge of a smile tugging at his mouth.

Red kisses his temple. **“Nah. You brought your home with you.”**
