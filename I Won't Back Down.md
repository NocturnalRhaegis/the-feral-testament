The scent was faint at first, just a whisper on the wind. Blood. Coppery and warm, mixed with something older, deeper—the scent of fear, of rage. Nocturnal Rhaegis froze, his breath catching in his throat. The familiar smell triggered memories he had tried so hard to bury. It was like striking a match in the dark, a flicker that quickly roared into an inferno of images, sensations, and sounds.

He stood at the edge of the forest now, staring into the thick canopy of trees, but his mind was far away. He was back in Romania. Back in **her** cage.

The cage was cramped, a stone prison of cold granite and iron bars, barely wide enough for him to stretch out. The bloodstained floor—granite slabs slick with crimson, accented by jagged black marble inlays—was always damp, always reeking of rot. The torches flickered in their sconces, casting shadows that danced in a mocking rhythm across the jagged walls. Maryshka Nightfire preferred the old ways—torchlight, candles, things from a time when the world was more primitive. Even with electricity humming through the walls of her manor, the pits where she kept her "toys" were lit only by fire. It was a cruel nod to the past, a deliberate reminder of who held the power.

*Well, I won't back down*  
*No I won't back down*  
*You could stand me up at the gates of Hell*  
*But I won't back down*

*No I'll stand my ground*  
*Won't be turned around*  
*And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down*  
*Gonna stand my ground*  
*And I won't back down*

The pit was worse than the cage. A circular oubliette, walls twenty feet high, slick with moisture and smooth as glass, impossible to scale. The floor was dirt, packed so tightly that it felt like stone underfoot, but it was always wet with blood. The bodies of the fallen were removed, but their essence remained—copper and rot mingling with the cold air. The pit was a place of suffering, where beasts were broken and remade. For Maryshka’s amusement, for her experiments, for her lust for power.

*Hey baby*  
*There ain't no easy way out (I won't back down)*  
*Hey I will stand my ground*  
*And I won't back down*

That night, the scent of blood had filled his nostrils long before he realized he was standing in it. His first shift had torn through him like a storm, a wave of agony that shattered his bones and reshaped his flesh. He was a gangly twenty-year-old, more scientist than warrior, his mind sharp but his body still adjusting to its new reality. When the change hit, there was no warning, no mercy—only pain. His skin split, his muscles tore, and his bones realigned as the beast within clawed its way to the surface.

*Well, I know what's right*  
*I got just one life*  
*In a world that keeps on pushin' me around*  
*But I'll stand my ground*  
*And I won't back down*

He remembered the screams—his own, and then someone else’s.

A boy, no older than him. Thin, with pale skin and dark hair, wide eyes filled with terror. His name had been Alexander. Noc never forgot that. Alexander had been a captive, like him, thrown into the pits for Maryshka’s amusement, for her twisted games. Neither of them stood a chance.

That night, the beast took over. Noc didn’t recognize himself in the mirror anymore; he was a creature of fur and claws, teeth bared, and eyes gleaming with predatory hunger. The boy had no chance—no time to plead, no time to scream. Noc’s claws found his throat, and in a single, brutal motion, the boy's life was torn away.

Alexander's body hit the dirt floor, eyes still wide, blood spilling out in thick rivers that soaked the earth beneath them. His last breath, wet and rasping, hung in the air as the world seemed to go silent for a brief, agonizing moment.

And then there was only the smell of copper and rot.

*Hey baby*  
*There ain't no easy way out (I won't back down)*  
*Hey I will stand my ground (I won't back down)*  
*And I won't back down*

*Hey baby*  
*There ain't no easy way out (I won't back down)*  
*Hey I won't back down*

Noc hadn’t felt human in that moment. He felt like nothing—just an empty vessel of instinct and rage. He had slaughtered an innocent, and for what? Maryshka had smiled from above, her black-clad guards standing in stoic silence, their armor catching the flicker of torchlight. It had been a test, a cruel initiation, and Noc had failed. He had allowed the beast to take control. His humanity had been left bleeding on the dirt, alongside Alexander’s body.

He had screamed then, but no one came. His cries were swallowed by the pit, by the walls that reached too high, by the bloodstained floor that would never be clean again.

Now, standing at the edge of the forest, the memory of that night tore at him. The scent was there again—blood and fear. He closed his eyes, fists clenching at his sides, feeling the sharp sting of his nails digging into his palms. The beast stirred within him, always restless, always waiting.

**Monster.**

*Hey baby*  
*There ain't no easy way out (I won't back down)*  
*Hey I will stand my ground (I won't back down)*  
*And I won't back down*

*Hey baby*  
*There ain't no easy way out (I won't back down)*  
*Hey I won't back down*

That’s what Maryshka had called him after that night. That’s what he had become. A mindless killer, a slave to the beast. He told himself he had no choice, that Maryshka had made him into this. But the truth gnawed at him like a wound that never healed. He had killed. He had felt the life drain from another human being, felt the warmth of their blood on his hands.

**Was he truly in control?**

His breath came in ragged gasps now, his heart pounding as if he were back in that pit, surrounded by the echoes of torches and laughter. He opened his eyes and looked out into the forest, but all he saw was the oubliette. He felt the dirt beneath his feet, the smell of rot in the air. He was that creature again, trapped in a body that wasn’t his own, teetering on the edge of losing himself completely.

The beast stirred, but this time, it didn’t take over.

*Well, I won't back down*  
*No I won't back down*  
*You could stand me up at the gates of Hell*  
*But I won't back down*

He breathed in deeply, his jaw clenched tight. The blood, the fear, the rage—it was there, inside him, always waiting. But it wasn’t everything. Not anymore.

He stared into the abyss of the forest, his heart still racing, but his hands slowly unclenched. The scars of that night were etched deep into his soul, but he wouldn’t let them define him. Not tonight. Not anymore.

As he stood there, with the memory of Alexander’s last breath still haunting him, Noc whispered to the night air, a promise to himself, to the beast inside him, and to the boy he had killed.

“I’m not a monster. Not anymore.”

And this time, he almost believed it.
