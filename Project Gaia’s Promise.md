## üß¨ SCIENTIFIC BRANCH (Led by Noc Rhaegis)

**Goal:** Improve biological viability of Garou, kinfolk, and hybrid lineages without triggering the Curse or Wyrm-taint.

### Key Focus Areas:

1. **Genetic Recovery Archives (Riegel‚Äôs Legacy)**
    
    - Utilize Riegel‚Äôs Umbra-backed genetic notes to reconstruct pre-Curse baseline DNA.
        
    - Analyze lost Apis and extinct Fera genome remnants for viable traits.
        
2. **Hybrid Viability Studies**
    
    - Research successful mating across tribes and lines (Garou √ó Kinfolk, Garou √ó Fera, etc).
        
    - Establish protocols to reduce deformity, miscarriage, and stillbirth.
        
3. **The Curse Suppression Serum (Codename: Mercy Gene)**
    
    - Develop a non-invasive genetic modulator that neutralizes the most aggressive traits of the Garou curse in vitro.
        
4. **Conception Tracking & Viability Algorithms**
    
    - AI-assisted prediction of optimal conception times based on spiritual + biological data.
        
    - Longitudinal fertility health mapping.

## üêù SPIRITUAL BRANCH (Led by Karma Orks)

**Goal:** Re-awaken the divine connection between Gaia, the spirits of fertility, and the Garou womb.

### Key Focus Areas:

1. **Apis Rites of Quickening**
    
    - Reconstructed rituals of the Apis, focused on blessing unions, purifying bloodlines, and invoking ancestral guardians.
        
    - Hybridized with Garou moots and tribal rites for cultural accessibility.
        
2. **Temple Womb Sanctuaries**
    
    - Establish sacred spaces in each caern where Garou and Kinfolk seeking conception can receive spiritual alignment and emotional restoration.
        
    - Includes guided meditation, spirit blessings, and ancestral dreaming.
        
3. **Calling the Unborn**
    
    - Karma teaches rites that communicate with potential children in the Umbra, offering them safety, names, and invitation.
        
4. **Ritual of Three Threads**
    
    - A sacred bonding rite where both science, spirit, and soul are honored:
        
        - One thread for genetics
            
        - One for spirit guidance
            
        - One for the bond of choice/love
