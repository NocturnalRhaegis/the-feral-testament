The night Nocturnal Rhaegis escaped was a night that would be burned into Maryshka Nightfire’s memory for eternity. The ancient halls of her Romanian fortress stood silent, but the moment she stepped into the dark, cold corridor where his cell had been, she felt it—an absence, a void where her favorite plaything had been.

She paused, her long fingers tracing the stone walls as if she could feel his heat still lingering there. Nocturnal Rhaegis. Her obsession. Her pet. The boy she had plucked from his promising life, that scrawny, studious thing with eyes full of fire and defiance. She had seen potential in him, more than he could have ever imagined. His mind had fascinated her—so sharp, so disciplined, but it was that underlying resistance, that refusal to break, that captivated her the most.

*You let me violate you*  
*You let me desecrate you*  
*You let me penetrate you*  
*You let me complicate you*

Even now, standing in the empty cell, she could recall the first time she saw him. He had been so young, so fragile, and she had been certain—certain she could mold him, turn him from that naïve, bookish boy into something stronger, something dangerous. **Her** dangerous man.

She paced slowly, her thoughts a venomous tangle of rage and fascination. How many nights had she pushed him to the edge? How many times had she bruised that pale skin, left him gasping for breath, crying out in pain, thinking that maybe this time, this time he would break? But he never did.

Oh, he had screamed, he had wept, but even when Stockholm Syndrome wrapped him in its velvet chains, when he started to obey her, there had always been something missing. A piece of him that refused to bend, a defiance woven deep into his bones. It infuriated her. She had torn him apart, piece by piece, hoping that with every cruel touch, every degrading act, he would learn. That he would submit.

*I broke apart my insides*  
*(Help me) I've got no soul to sell*  
*(Help me) the only thing that works for me*  
*Help me get away from myself*

*I wanna fuck you like an animal*  
*I wanna feel you from the inside*  
*I wanna fuck you like an animal*  
*My whole existence is flawed*  
*You get me closer to God*

But he never had. Not fully.

Maryshka clenched her fists, her long nails digging into her palms, drawing thin lines of blood. The memory of his steel, that unspoken defiance, gnawed at her like a hunger she couldn’t sate. She had given him everything, hadn't she? A place by her side. Power, control, even the chance to rise above what he had been. All he had to do was submit, to be hers. Completely.

And he had the gall to escape.

She stormed through the corridor, her cloak billowing behind her as her boots struck the stone floor with purpose. Her mind raced. How long had he been gone? A few hours? Less? It didn't matter. She would find him. She would drag him back. And this time, oh this time, she would break him. She would find that piece of him that still clung to hope, that foolish belief in freedom, and she would crush it beneath her heel.

Maryshka’s lips curled into a twisted smile as she thought of all the ways she would make him pay. She had been kind, in her way. She had offered him power, even affection. If he had just given in, she would have treated him like a king. But no. He had to keep fighting. He had to keep that streak of rebellion burning inside him.

She could almost hear his voice in her head, low and steady, that same voice that had once cried out her name in pain but had never truly begged. Never truly submitted. It enraged her, excited her, made her want him all the more. She had thought about him, dreamed about him—how he would finally break. How he would finally be hers, body and soul.

*You can have my isolation*  
*You can have the hate that it brings*  
*You can have my absence of faith*  
*You can have my everything*

*you tear down my reason*  
*(Help me) it's your sex I can smell*  
*(Help me) you make me perfect*  
*Help me become somebody else*

But instead, he had slipped away. A shadow in the night.

She stormed into her chamber, where her lieutenants stood waiting, pale faces filled with fear and uncertainty. They knew what his escape meant. They knew the storm that was brewing inside her. Her voice was calm, terrifyingly calm, when she spoke.

"Find him."

Her eyes gleamed with something dark, something cold. She would not let this stand. Not after all she had done for him. He belonged to her. He was hers to control, to manipulate, to break. And if she had to chase him to the ends of the earth, she would remind him of that.

*Through every forest*  
*Above the trees*  
*Within my stomach*  
*Scraped off my knees*  
*I drink the honey*  
*Inside your hive*  
*You are the reason*  
*I stay alive*

As her lieutenants scattered, Maryshka stood alone in her chamber, the shadows flickering across her face. A small, cruel smile played on her lips as she imagined the fear in Nocturnal’s eyes when she found him. He would run, he would hide, but he wouldn’t escape. Not really. She had left a mark on him, one that would never fade. No matter how far he fled, he would always remember who had shaped him. Who had made him strong. Who had made him hers.

"Run, little wolf," she whispered to the empty room. "But you’ll never be free."

She would find him. And when she did, she would make him remember. Ten years, twenty, it didn’t matter. She would haunt his steps, a constant reminder of where he belonged.

*I wanna fuck you like an animal*  
*I wanna feel you from the inside*  
*I wanna fuck you like an animal*  
*My whole existence is flawed*  
*You get me closer to God*

And when she finally dragged him back, broken and bleeding, he would beg for the mercy she had once offered him. But it would be too late.

Much too late.
