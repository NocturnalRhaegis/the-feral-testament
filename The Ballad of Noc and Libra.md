The night of September 19, 2015, was thick with tension in the air as Nocturnal Rhaegis crouched in the shadows of the stone corridor, every muscle coiled like a predator ready to strike. The ancient walls of Maryshka Nightfire's Romanian fortress echoed with silence, but that silence was deceptive, a predator in itself. It had been his prison for far too long, every brick a witness to his torment. But tonight—tonight was different. Tonight, he was going to break free.

The moon hung low in the sky, casting long, jagged shadows across the floor. Noc moved like one of them, slipping between the darkness, his breath measured, heart pounding like the war drums of the beast that lurked beneath his skin. He wasn’t leaving alone. In the cells behind him, others were waiting—Libra Topaz, a 17-year-old Irish girl with fire in her eyes, and four others who shared his fate. Maryshka had taken their freedom, their dignity, but tonight Noc was reclaiming it.

*I was gone for fourteen days*  
*I could've been gone for more*  
*Held up in the intensive care ward*  
*Lyin' on the floor*  
  
*I was gone for all those days*  
*But I was not all alone*  
*I made friends with a lot of people*  
*In the danger zone*

He glanced down the corridor. The iron gates were close now, the last barrier between them and freedom. He could feel the pull of the night air beyond those doors, the crisp taste of liberty waiting just on the other side. But it wasn’t just the gates—it was the vampires. Their eyes were everywhere, their senses sharpened by centuries of hunger. Every step Noc took felt like he was walking a tightrope between life and death.

*See my lonely life unfold*  
*I see it every day*  
*See my lonely mind explode*  
*Since I've gone away*

With a hand signal, he beckoned the others. Libra crept forward, her movements graceful yet cautious. She had grown into a fighter during their time in captivity, but she was still a girl—too young for the horrors she'd endured. The others followed, their expressions etched with the hope they had long buried.

The gate loomed ahead, locked with thick chains. Noc felt for the key he'd stolen from one of Maryshka’s henchmen. His fingers trembled as he slid it into the lock, the sound of metal against metal echoing in the stillness. Every second stretched like a blade over his throat, the tension unbearable. He twisted the key.

Click.

The chains fell. The gate swung open. Freedom.

But freedom was never so simple.

*I think I lost some weight there*  
*And I—I'm sure I need some rest*  
*Sleepin' don't come very easy*  
*In a straight white vest*  
  
*Sure'd like to see that little children*  
*She's only four years old... old*  
*I'd give her back all of her playthings*  
*Even even the ones I stole*

A howl ripped through the night—the unmistakable call of a werewolf, one of Maryshka’s beasts, alerting the others. They had been spotted.

"Run!" Noc hissed, grabbing Libra’s hand and pushing her forward. His heart surged with adrenaline as they bolted down the stone steps and into the forest beyond. Shadows flickered between the trees, dark shapes moving fast—vampires. Noc could feel their eyes on him, hungry and cold.

*See my lonely life unfold*  
*I see it every day*  
*See my lonely mind explode*  
*Since I've gone away*

The forest was a labyrinth of twisting roots and gnarled branches, but Noc knew the path. He had memorized every inch of it during his time in chains. They ran through the darkness, the sound of their breath heavy in the night, the soft thud of footsteps blending with the distant rustle of leaves. Behind them, the growls and shrieks of pursuit grew closer. Closer.

Noc could feel the beast inside him stir, the wolf clawing at his insides, begging for release. But he held it back. Not yet. He couldn’t lose control now, not with the others relying on him. He gritted his teeth and pushed harder, dragging Libra with him as they wove through the trees, the others struggling to keep up.

*I wanna get outta here*  
*I wanna get outta here*  
*I—I've gotta I've gotta get outta here*  
*I—I gotta get out of here*  
  
*I gotta get out of here*  
*I gotta get outta here*  
*I gotta get outta here*

*Ya gotta let me out of here*  
*Let me outta here*  
*I gotta get outta here*  
*I gotta get outta here*

They made it to the river’s edge—a narrow, winding stream that cut through the forest like a blade. On the other side lay safety, for now. Without a word, Noc plunged into the water, the cold biting into his skin. Libra followed, the others close behind.

The current was strong, threatening to pull them under, but Noc fought against it, his limbs burning with the effort. The vampires wouldn’t follow them into the water—too much of a risk. As they reached the opposite bank, Noc turned, watching the dark figures pause on the far side, their red eyes glowing like embers in the night.

They wouldn’t give up, not easily. But for now, they were safe.

The next ten days were a blur of movement, fear, and exhaustion. By day, they traveled, hitching rides in cars and trucks, stowing away on freighters when they could. By night, they hid, always alert, always watching. Every shadow was a potential threat, every unfamiliar face a danger. But they kept moving. Noc kept them moving.

*See my lonely life unfold*  
*I see it every day*  
*See my lonely mind explode*  
*Blow up in my face*

On October 1, they arrived in London, dirty and exhausted, but alive. It was 3 a.m. when Noc managed to secure passage to New York. He didn’t sleep that night, his mind too occupied with the thought of Maryshka’s reach, with the knowledge that even oceans might not be enough to stop her from coming after them.

*I grabbed my hat and I got my coat*  
*And I—I ran into the street*  
*I saw a man that was choking there*  
*I guess he couldn't breathe*  
  
*Said to myself this is very strange*  
*I'm glad it wasn't me*  
*But now I hear those sirens callin'*  
*And so I am not free*

The flight was long, 14 hours of silent tension, but when they touched down at Kennedy Airport, Noc felt the weight begin to lift from his shoulders. He watched as the others reunited with their families, tears of joy and relief in their eyes.

But Libra stayed. She had no family to go home to, no one waiting for her. Noc saw the fear in her eyes—the fear of being alone again—and he couldn’t leave her behind. Together, they caught a bus heading west, toward New Mexico, toward home.

By the time they reached Los Alamos on October 2, the sun was setting behind the mountains, casting long shadows across the landscape. Noc stood on the side of the road, staring at the place he had once called home. It had been years since he’d seen it, years since he’d felt the warmth of familiarity. But now, it felt like a different man stood there—a man forged in the fires of suffering, of captivity and escape.

As he turned to Libra, he saw the same look in her eyes—the look of someone who had seen too much, who had endured too much. He put a hand on her shoulder, offering what little comfort he could.

"We made it," he whispered.

*See my lonely life unfold*  
*I see it every day*  
*See my lonely mind explode*  
*Blow up in my face*

For the first time in years, Noc allowed himself to believe it. They had made it. But he knew, deep down, that his battle wasn’t over. Maryshka was still out there, and his past would haunt him until he found a way to stop her for good.

But for now, they were free.

And that was enough.
