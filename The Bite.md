_March 30th, 2014 — Somewhere deep in the Peruvian Amazon_

The jungle was a living, breathing symphony. Days before it all fell apart, Nocturnal Miguel Rhaegis had learned to move with its rhythm — the chatter of capuchins, the humid sighs of wind through thick leaves, the low drone of insects filling the thick air like static. He kept meticulous notes even in the heat and haze, his journals heavy with data and observations: blood panels from local tribespeople, environmental readings, dietary logs, fungal spores scraped from bark, parasites fished from water sources.

It had been exhausting work — unforgiving, relentless, and lonely. But Noc had always worked best alone. He hadn’t taken a team because that required grants, and grants required funding, and he was already burning the last of his savings just to be there. So he slept in a hammock slung between trees, bathed in riverwater, and catalogued his microbiological findings by solar lamp after dusk. Even his microscope was secondhand, propped up on crates and an old field desk. But he made it work. He always had.

The locals had helped him, at first — a few men and women from a nearby village who understood the land and respected his strange, quiet dedication. But when the warnings started, they came less often. Whispers of a _bruja_ — a sorceress, a ghost-woman of the jungle. They begged him to leave. Told him the air had turned wrong. That things were moving in the trees at night that should not be.

He didn’t believe them — not truly. Not until the camp went quiet.

They were just gone. Their shelters dismantled, trails scrubbed clean, fires left to burn out. A final warning scrawled hastily in Spanish on the side of his supply tent: _“Se acerca la sombra. No le mires a los ojos.”_  
**The shadow approaches. Do not meet her eyes.**

Still, Noc stayed. Of course he did. The jungle had always held danger — jaguars, pythons, venomous insects. He chalked the warnings up to superstition and stubbornly pressed on. He had research to complete, dammit. Blood samples to test. Hypotheses to confirm.

He didn’t know she was watching.

For two days, the forest pressed inward. Quieter. Heavier. The sounds of life became muffled, distant — like they were afraid. Even the birdsong disappeared.

The attack came during the most human of moments: while relieving himself behind a broad ficus tree just after dusk. No gear. No defenses. His pants around his thighs when the growl came — low, bone-deep, like gravel soaked in hatred. And then the flash of movement: white teeth, shining eyes, the blur of fur and claws.

Maldaldo Galacia was no ordinary wolf. He had been a man once, a predator in a tailored suit, all smooth speech and quiet menace. At night, though, he was something else — something primal. His jaws clamped around Noc’s side, tearing through flesh like wet paper. Muscle peeled away. Tendons snapped. The pain was unimaginable, a white-hot shriek of agony that sent Noc’s vision blurring.

He tried to scream, but the wolf crushed the air from his lungs with another bite, this one rending across his back. He couldn’t move. Could barely breathe. Blood pooled beneath him, soaking the jungle floor, the scent of iron mingling with the damp earth and the bitter musk of the wolf’s coat.

Above them, on a high outcropping of black stone, she stood.

Maryska Dragomir. Pale as moonlight. Dressed in silver and shadow. Her eyes were pits — bottomless wells that watched, waiting, curious.

The wolf backed away eventually, panting, its mouth painted in Noc’s blood. It sat beside her like a loyal hound as she knelt and looked down upon the broken boy bleeding in the mud.

They never survive, she thought.

Humans weren’t meant to endure the bite. Their bodies broke under the strain of transformation. The virus ripped through bone and mind, crushing them in a merciless rebirth. Those who didn’t die screaming, went mad.

But Noc didn’t die.

He _screamed_, oh yes — long and hoarse until his throat was raw. He _bled_, shaking violently as the infection tore through him like wildfire. He clawed at the dirt, lungs gasping for air that wouldn’t come. Stars blinked above the canopy, indifferent, and still he didn’t die.

And that… that was _interesting._

Maryska tilted her head, a slow smile curving her lips. Her eyes glittered. She saw potential now — not just another corpse, not a shattered thing to be discarded.

She saw a toy.

A test subject.

A soul to _break._

And as Noc lay there, barely conscious, body torn and twisted, the first shudders of his transformation rippling through ruined nerves… something changed. In him. A fire sparked. The kind that doesn’t come from anger or vengeance, but from refusal. From the decision — primal and pure — _not to die._

And in that defiant heartbeat, the boy became the monster. And the monster would one day become more than even Maryska could have imagined.
