Los Alamos to Cambridge – Age 22

Miguel never really believed in miracles. But Xavier's sudden recovery felt close enough.

It began slow—fewer hospital visits, steadier hands, more color in his skin. By sixteen, Xavier was taller than Miguel and running on a treadmill without collapsing. The doctors had no real explanation. Genes that once doomed him to a short life had… stabilized. Shifted. Adapted.

Miguel wanted answers. Not for Xavier’s sake anymore—he was thriving. But for himself. Because if suffering could reverse, if broken blueprints could rewrite themselves, then maybe every theory he chased in the dark had a spark of truth.

By twenty-two, Miguel was the youngest in his Master’s program—accepted on a full scholarship to a competitive genetic sciences initiative in Cambridge. He worked twice as hard as everyone else, slept half as much, and still outperformed most of his peers. Not because he needed to prove something—because he couldn’t stop.

The lab was his sanctuary. A sterile heaven of microscopes and soft glows, where blood didn’t stain walls and voices never rose above casual inquiry.

And at the center of that sanctuary was Professor Riegel Orks.

Dr. Orks was a geneticist with the soul of a poet and the hands of a pianist—quick, meticulous, and precise. He had the gentle bearing of a man who had seen brutality and survived it by refusing to become it.

From the start, he saw something in Miguel that other instructors missed: a rage so tightly folded into ambition it was practically indistinguishable.

Most professors challenged Miguel. Orks channeled him.

Genetics 301 was where it started. A deep dive into gene expression, mutation patterns, and epigenetic drift. Miguel’s favorite part was the CRISPR lab, where they edited bacteria strains by hand, stitching new instructions into life itself like digital gods. Miguel excelled, naturally, but Orks didn’t praise him for speed or brilliance.

“You treat every sequence like it owes you an apology,” Orks once said. “Like if you just crack the code, the past will undo itself.”

Miguel didn’t respond. But he came to office hours the next day.

Again. And again.

Soon, they weren’t just talking about methyl groups and telomere decay. Orks asked about New Mexico. About Xavier. He never pushed, but he listened. And Miguel, who had spent his entire life surviving silence, began to speak.

It was Orks who first suggested the Amazon.

“There’s a tribe,” he explained one evening, passing Miguel a thin dossier sealed in a dull manila folder. “Remote. Unmapped. Their genetic markers don’t follow any known phylogenetic pattern. There’s a hypothesis that their genome may have latent or novel epigenetic regulation we’ve never seen.”

Miguel opened the folder and stared. He didn’t speak for a full minute.

“You want me to chase godblood.”

“I want you to chase truth. Whatever shape it takes.”

That was the moment Miguel stopped seeing Riegel as a professor and started seeing him as something more. A mentor, yes. But also a compass. Someone who believed in who Miguel might become—outside the trauma, outside the teeth.

Miguel agreed to lead the field expedition.

It would be his thesis. His magnum opus.

His last step as a man of science.

Before the jungle swallowed him. Before the bite.

**Cambridge, Office of Professor Riegel Orks—The Turning Point**

Miguel Rhaegis sat across from Professor Riegel Orks, his eyes flickering between the cluttered desk and the quiet, imposing figure of the older man. The office was exactly as it had been every time Miguel had come here—disorganized yet somehow always brimming with purpose. Books on genetics and ancient cultures lined the walls, papers were strewn across the desk, and the faint hum of a heater in the corner kept the room just warm enough to make the musty scent of old papers feel comfortable, familiar.

Orks, his professor and academic advisor, was an imposing figure—calm, composed, and always so sure of himself. Miguel looked up to him in a way he never could with his own father, who had never given him the time of day beyond criticism and blame. Orks was different—encouraging, insightful, and always ready to push Miguel just a little bit further. In many ways, he was the father figure Miguel had never had.

“Miguel,” Orks said, voice smooth but with that edge of quiet authority. “I believe it’s time you move forward with your research. The tribe you’ve been studying in the Amazon—the one whose genetic patterns piqued your interest—there’s something there. Something you need to explore further.”

Miguel leaned forward, his eyes bright with excitement. The Amazon was exactly what he needed to prove himself in the field of genetics—his big chance, his moment to make a name for himself. He had spent years at Cambridge, struggling to gain recognition, but now, it felt like his breakthrough was within reach.

“I’m ready,” Miguel said eagerly. “I’ve been working on the tribal genetics, and I think I’ve found something. This could be the key to the next stage of my research. But I don’t know if I can do it alone.”

Orks leaned back in his chair, an inscrutable expression on his face, though his lips curled upward in a small, approving smile. “You won’t be alone, Miguel. I’ve arranged everything. The resources, the materials, the knowledge. It’s all here.”

He slid a thick dossier across the desk to Miguel. It was neat, organized, with pages upon pages of data, photographs, and field notes. Everything about the tribe, their rituals, their genetics—but there was something more. Something that made Miguel’s fingers hesitate as he reached for the file. The paper was smooth, almost too perfect, and there was a faint smell of something unfamiliar on the edges. A smell that reminded him of… something sterile. Clean.

“This is everything you need,” Orks said, his voice calm, almost soothing. “You’ve been on the right track all along. Now you have the information to take your work to the next level.”

Miguel opened the file, scanning the first few pages quickly. He saw the familiar notes on the tribe’s bloodlines, rituals, and ceremonies. But what made his breath catch was the mention of genetics—the specifics of the tribe’s DNA, and then, strangely, the mention of some kind of foreign influence.

“What’s this?” Miguel asked, pointing to a section where there were references to genetic materials from outside the tribe, carefully cross-referenced with strange symbols and notes.

Orks smiled knowingly, his eyes glinting with something unreadable. “I’ve done some additional research. There’s more to the story than just the tribe’s genetics. A certain… lineage has been followed, and there are connections to other, more elusive elements. I’m certain you’ll uncover them on your trip. It’s an opportunity to further your research into the unknown.”

Miguel didn’t see the hidden layers beneath Orks’ words, nor the meaning behind the way the professor’s eyes lingered on the file. For him, this was all part of the natural progression—he had been guided to this point, to this discovery, and it felt like his hard work was finally paying off.

“Thank you,” Miguel said, his voice filled with gratitude. “I don’t know what I’d do without you, Professor. You’ve given me so much already.”

Orks didn’t say anything at first. Instead, he watched Miguel, his expression unreadable. After a moment, he leaned forward slightly, his voice dropping lower, almost as if he were letting Miguel in on a secret.

“This is just the beginning, Miguel,” Orks said, his words filled with quiet, measured weight. “You’re about to step into a much larger world than you’ve ever known. The work you’ll do there, with the tribe… it will change everything.”

Miguel nodded, completely unaware of the deeper meaning behind Orks’ cryptic statement. He felt an overwhelming sense of trust and awe for the professor, who had helped him so much already. Orks had always been there for him, like a father, always one step ahead, guiding him with gentle hands.

As Miguel gathered the dossier, preparing to leave for the Amazon, Orks’ voice followed him.

“Remember, Miguel,” he said softly. “You’re not just uncovering the past. You’re shaping the future. And you are exactly the right person for it.”

Miguel, heart swelling with pride and anticipation, didn’t question the oddity of the statement. He didn’t think to ask how Orks could be so sure, or why he’d gone to such lengths to ensure Miguel’s success.

In his mind, Professor Orks was simply a brilliant mentor, guiding him to greatness.

He had no idea that Orks—no, **Riegel Orks**—was already pulling strings, already setting events into motion that would affect the course of his life in ways he couldn’t even imagine. All Miguel knew was that for the first time, he was on the edge of something _big_. And Professor Orks was right there, leading him into it.
